00:12	you
00:13	[Music]
00:16	[Applause]
00:21	so for the past 20 years I've been
00:24	helping Malaysians and other Southeast
00:27	Asians to speak better English and
00:30	through training thousands of Southeast
00:34	Asians I've discovered a very surprising
00:36	truth I've discovered that how well
00:39	somebody communicates in English
00:42	actually has very little to do with
00:45	their English level it has a lot to do
00:48	with their attitude towards English
00:51	there are people out there who have a
00:54	very very low level of English and they
00:56	can communicate very very well one of
00:59	them that I remember was a student a
01:00	participant of my name Faisal he was a
01:03	factory supervisor English level very
01:06	very low but this guy could just sit and
01:09	listen to anybody
01:10	very calmly clearly and then he could
01:13	respond absolutely express his thoughts
01:17	beautifully at a very low level of
01:20	English so today I want to share with
01:22	you what is so different about people
01:26	like faisal how do they do it and second
01:30	of all why is this so important not only
01:32	to you but to your children to your
01:34	community and to the future of Malaysia
01:36	and third of all what's one thing you
01:39	can do starting today if you want to
01:42	speak with that calm clear confidence
01:45	that people like faisal has so first of
01:48	all what is so different how do people
01:51	like faisal do it so to answer that
01:53	question i'm going to take you back
01:55	about ten years okay so I was training
01:57	staff at that time and my daughter at
02:00	that time was taking piano lessons and I
02:04	started to notice two really strong
02:07	similarities between my daughter's
02:10	attitude or thinking towards playing the
02:13	piano and a lot of Malaysians thinking
02:16	or attitude towards English now first of
02:20	all I should tell you my daughter
02:21	absolutely hated
02:24	you know hated the lessons hated
02:26	practicing this is my daughter
02:28	practicing piano okay this is as good as
02:30	it got this is the real thing and she
02:35	dreaded going to piano lessons because
02:37	to my daughter going to piano lessons
02:41	she was filled with this sort of dread
02:44	because it was all about not screwing up
02:47	right because like for a lot of piano
02:50	students to both my daughter and her
02:52	teacher her success in piano was
02:56	measured by how few mistakes she made
02:58	now at the same time I noticed that a
03:01	lot of Malaysians went into English
03:03	conversations with the same sort of
03:05	feeling of dread this sort of feeling
03:08	that they were going to be judged by how
03:10	many mistakes they were going to make
03:12	and whether or not they were going to
03:14	screw up now the second similarity that
03:18	I noticed was to do a self image she
03:21	seemed my daughter she knew what good
03:22	piano sounded like right because we've
03:24	all heard good piano and she knew what
03:27	her level was and she knew how long
03:30	she'd have to play for to speak to play
03:33	like that and a lot of Malaysians I
03:36	noticed had this idea of what good
03:39	proper English is supposed to sound like
03:41	and what they're I see a lot of you
03:44	nodding and what their English sounded
03:46	like and how far they'd have to go to
03:48	get there and they also felt like they
03:52	were like my daughter just bad bad piano
03:55	player bad English speaker right my
03:58	English not so good luck and ah sorry ah
04:01	Shia cannot up so I could see these
04:04	similarities but I still couldn't figure
04:06	out okay what is it about these people
04:09	like Faisal that are so different that
04:11	can just do it smoothly calmly with
04:14	confidence and one day I discovered that
04:18	answer and I discovered it quite by
04:19	chance it was a day when my computer
04:22	broke down and I had to go to a cyber
04:24	cafe now okay was my first time and I
04:27	discovered cyber cafes are disgusting
04:29	places okay they're really gross they're
04:32	smelly and
04:33	are filled with boys and they're all
04:35	playing noisy violent games they're just
04:39	disgusting places but I had to go there
04:42	so I sit down and I start noticing this
04:45	guy beside me and I become very very
04:47	interested in this guy next to me now
04:50	this guy is playing this game that is
04:52	basically it's like shooting people
04:56	until they die and that's it right
04:59	that's the game right and I'm noticing
05:01	that this guy is not very good he's like
05:05	in fact terrible right because I'm
05:07	looking and I'm seeing like a lot of
05:09	shooting and and and and not much dying
05:12	right but what really interested me was
05:16	behind this lousy player were three of
05:20	his friends sort of standing there
05:22	watching him play and what I really
05:25	noticed was even though this guy was
05:27	terrible even though his friends are
05:29	watching him there was no embarrassment
05:30	there was no feeling of being judged
05:33	there was no shyness in fact quite the
05:36	opposite this guy's like totally focused
05:39	on the bad guys smile on his face
05:42	all he can think about is is is killing
05:45	these guys right and I'm watching him
05:48	and I suddenly realized this is it this
05:53	is the same attitude attitude that
05:56	people like faisal have when they speak
05:59	english just like this guy when faisal
06:02	goes into an english conversation he
06:05	doesn't feel judged he's entirely
06:07	focused on the person that he's speaking
06:09	to and the result he wants to get he's
06:14	got no self awareness no thoughts about
06:16	his own mistakes now i want to share
06:19	with you a real true example to paint a
06:22	picture of somebody who speaks english
06:25	like they're playing piano and someone
06:28	who speaks english like they're playing
06:29	a computer game and this is a true story
06:32	happened to me
06:34	a while ago I was in a pharmacy I had to
06:38	buy Omega my doctor said I should get
06:40	omega and I go to the shelf there's tons
06:43	of Omega there's Omega
06:45	hi in DHA Omega that's high in EPA I
06:49	don't know which one to buy now the
06:52	sales rep happened to be there and I saw
06:55	she was like this well-dressed
06:56	professional woman I walk over to her
06:59	and I see this look as she sees me this
07:01	sort of it's a look I recognize very
07:04	well her eyes go all wide it's sort of
07:06	that panic oh my god I got to speak to a
07:08	native speaker and she's gonna judge me
07:10	and notice my mistakes I go up to her
07:14	and I explain my situation which which
07:17	Omega do I get and she starts explaining
07:20	to me everything about DHA and EPA you
07:24	could possibly imagine
07:25	she speaks very quickly goes all around
07:28	in circles and when she finishes no idea
07:33	what to buy so I turned to the girl
07:37	behind the counter now the girl behind
07:39	the counter I heard her before her
07:40	English level is very low but when I
07:43	walk over to her this girl there's no
07:47	fear in fact she's just looking at me
07:49	you know that look like yeah okay so how
07:53	yeah I've been in Malaysia a long time
07:58	so I go up to her and I explained the
08:01	problem EPA DHA she looks at me she says
08:04	okay uh uh EPA for heart DHA for brain
08:16	your heart okay or not so I said yeah
08:22	yeah my I said my heart is really it's I
08:25	think is pretty good she says your brain
08:30	okay or not
08:31	I said yet no no my brain is not as good
08:37	as it used to be she look she said Oh
08:39	Kayla you take omega DHA can problems
08:44	alright so we've got two different kinds
08:47	of communicators we've got the one who's
08:50	got a high level but totally focused on
08:52	herself and getting it right and
08:54	therefore very ineffective we've got
08:58	another one low level totally focused on
09:02	the person she's talking to and getting
09:04	a result effective and therein lies the
09:07	difference now why is this distinction
09:12	so important not just to you to your
09:14	children but to the future of Malaysia
09:17	and countries like Malaysia and to
09:19	answer that let's take a look at who
09:22	actually is speaking English in the
09:24	world today okay so if we looked at all
09:27	of the English conversations in the
09:30	whole world taking place right now on
09:33	planet Earth we would see that for every
09:36	native speaker like me there are five
09:40	non-native speakers and if we listen to
09:45	every conversation in English on planet
09:47	earth right now we would notice that 96%
09:52	of those conversations involved
09:56	non-native English speakers only 4% of
09:59	those conversations are native speaker
10:02	to native speaker this is not my
10:04	language anymore this language belongs
10:06	to
10:06	you it's not an art to be mastered it's
10:11	just a tool to use to get a result and I
10:14	want to give you a real-life example of
10:17	what English is today in the world real
10:19	English today this is another true story
10:21	I was at a barbecue a little while ago
10:26	this was a barbecue for engineers
10:28	engineers from all over the world and
10:31	they were making hot dogs now some of
10:34	the hot dogs were regular hot dogs and
10:36	some were these these cheese hot dogs
10:38	you know where the cheese in the middle
10:40	french engineer is cooking the hot dogs
10:43	and he turns to this Korean engineer and
10:46	he says oh would you like our dog and
10:50	the Korean guy says yes please
10:53	he says do you want to cheese and the
10:57	Korean guy looks around at the table he
10:59	says uh I I no see cheese french guy
11:04	says Oz's or doggies contains cheese
11:09	Korean guy doesn't understand him right
11:11	so the French engineer tries again the
11:15	hot dog ISM is making from with the
11:21	cheese Korean guy still doesn't
11:24	understand he tries again he says the
11:26	hot dog is coming is some coming from
11:30	Nosa Jesus coming from the hot dog
11:32	Korean guy cannot understand now there's
11:35	Japanese engineer who's been listening
11:38	to this conversation turns to the Korean
11:40	engineer and he says ah ah xisa
11:43	integrator
11:46	he understands everybody understands so
11:51	this is what English is today it's just
11:53	a tool to play around with to get a
11:56	result like a computer game now the
12:01	challenge is that we know in schools all
12:05	around the world right English is not
12:07	really being taught like it's a tool to
12:10	play with it's still being taught like
12:12	it's an art to master and students are
12:15	judged more on correctness than on
12:18	clarity some of you might remember the
12:24	old comprehension exam in school does
12:27	anybody remember in school when you
12:28	would you would get a question about a
12:31	text that you read you'd have to read
12:33	through some text right and then answer
12:36	a question to show that you understood
12:38	the text and this may have happened to
12:41	you that you show that you understood
12:43	the text but you got a big X because you
12:48	made a little grammar mistake like this
12:50	student now this student clearly
12:52	understood paragraph four but no not
12:56	correct because he left the letter n off
12:59	the word environment but in the real
13:02	world what would matter in the real
13:05	world what would matter is did you
13:07	understand the email or did you
13:09	understand your customer so that you can
13:11	go ahead and take action now the problem
13:15	that I see here over and over is that
13:19	people take the attitude they developed
13:22	about English in school and they bring
13:24	it into their adult life and into their
13:27	work and if you're in a stressful
13:31	situation and you're having a
13:32	conversation and you're trying to give a
13:35	result to someone and say it correctly
13:38	your brain multitasks it cannot do two
13:41	things at once and what I see is the
13:43	brain just shutting down and you may
13:46	recognize these three symptoms of the
13:48	brain shutting
13:50	the first one is that you're listening
13:53	goes someone's talking to you and you're
13:56	so busy thinking about how you're going
13:59	to respond and and express yourself
14:02	correctly you don't actually hear what
14:04	the other person said and I can see a
14:07	lot of nodding in the audience
14:09	the second thing to go is you're
14:11	speaking your mind sort of shuts down
14:14	and that vocabulary you do know just
14:17	disappears and you the words don't come
14:19	out the third thing to go is your
14:22	confidence and the worst thing about
14:24	this is you may only be confident
14:27	because you cannot express yourself
14:29	clearly but to the person talking to you
14:33	they may misunderstand this as a lack of
14:36	confidence in your ability to do the job
14:39	to perform so if you want to speak
14:43	English like Faiz ell with that great
14:46	confidence here's the one thing that you
14:50	can do when you speak don't focus on
14:53	yourself focus on the other person and
14:57	the result you want to achieve
15:00	imagine a next generation of Malaysians
15:03	all with that wonderful confidence in
15:07	communication that Faizal has at any
15:09	level of English because let's remember
15:13	that English today is not an art to be
15:16	mastered it's just a tool to use to get
15:20	o a result and that tool belongs to you
15:26	thank you
15:27	[Applause]
