01:58 goli is 7 years old this year why did
02:02 you name her Goldie because she is
02:05 golden and her fur is soft and golden

26:05 hair gets all wet well why don't you
26:09 take an umbrella
26:10 I do take an umbrella but it still gets
26:13 wet I love rainy days what why because
26:19 when it rains I can stay inside and
26:22 drink some warm hot chocolate by the
26:24 fire after it rains all the plants and
26:27 trees turn green not in the winter well
26:31 it depends on where you live I live in
26:35 Hawaii it rains a lot but it is never
26:38 too cold there
26:39 I am from Colorado we have cold rain and
26:42 then it snows I hate snow too
26:45 what you don't like the snow I like a
26:49 little snow but when we have snow every
26:51 day for three months it gets old and
26:55 it's freezing
26:56 well maybe we should switch places
26:59 that's a good idea
27:02 rainy day I hate rainy days every time
27:06 it rains my hair gets all wet well why
27:11 don't you take an umbrella
27:12 I do take an umbrella but it still gets
27:16 wet I love rainy days what why because
27:21 when it rains I can stay inside and
27:25 drink some warm hot chocolate by the
27:27 fire after it rains all the plants and
27:30 trees turn green not in the winter well
