00:07	panic embarrassed exposed no that's not
00:14	how I'm
00:14	right now mostly those are the feelings
00:18	I had as a 14 year old boy on the very
00:22	first day of high school my English
00:25	teacher mr. Meredith had each of us
00:27	stand up and introduce ourselves when
00:31	class was over he called me over and
00:33	said hey Matt you're really good at this
00:35	talking thing I need you on Saturday to
00:39	show up at the speech contest doing as I
00:42	was told
00:43	I prepared a 10-minute presentation on
00:45	karate it was something I was passionate
00:48	about and it was pretty easy to do now
00:51	that cold September Saturday morning
00:54	when I showed up I was shocked the room
00:58	was much larger than I had expected
00:59	there were many more people there my
01:02	friends my friends parents who were
01:04	serving as judges and the girl I had a
01:07	crush on at that moment I felt
01:10	tremendous anxiety in the first 10
01:15	seconds of my 10-minute presentation my
01:18	life changed forever
01:20	you see I started my presentation with a
01:23	karate kick I was told to do this
01:25	because it would engage the audience and
01:26	get their attention but because of my
01:29	anxiety I forgot to put on my special
01:32	karate pants you know the ones with a
01:34	little extra room down there you get
01:38	where this is going I ripped my pants
01:40	from belt loop to zipper in that moment
01:44	I learned the impact of anxiety on
01:48	communication and from that moment I
01:51	have dedicated my life to helping others
01:54	learn to address this fear each of us
01:58	has stories to share
02:00	input to give and ideas to spread if we
02:05	allow anxiety to get in the way of that
02:08	we miss out society misses out and we
02:13	lose valuable diverse voices now I am
02:19	NOT alone in my anxiety in communication
02:22	if you have ever given spontaneous
02:25	feedback given a presentation
02:28	spoken up in a meeting or even asked
02:29	somebody on a date you know what this
02:32	anxiety feels like research shares with
02:35	us that 85% of people feel anxious in
02:39	high-stakes speaking situations and
02:41	quite frankly I think the other 15% are
02:46	lying I think we can create a situation
02:49	in which they would feel nervous too
02:53	so we must act to manage our anxiety so
02:57	we can accomplish our communication
02:59	goals now I use that word managed very
03:02	carefully I don't think we can ever
03:05	truly overcome our anxiety nor would we
03:09	want to anxiety is actually helpful it
03:12	gives us energy
03:13	it helps us focus it tells us what we're
03:16	doing is important but we must manage it
03:19	so it doesn't manage us and it's not
03:24	just to help us feel more confident it
03:26	helps our audience as well how do you
03:29	feel when you see a nervous speaker
03:32	communicate some of you might like to
03:34	watch people suffer but most of us don't
03:38	most of us feel very uncomfortable in
03:42	awkward in fact I call this second hand
03:45	anxiety the communicators anxiety makes
03:48	us feel nervous as an audience and
03:50	therefore we're distracted and we can't
03:52	pay attention to the message so we need
03:55	to manage our anxiety not just to help
03:57	ourselves as communicators but to help
03:58	our audience get our message before I
04:03	introduce you to some techniques that
04:04	can help us manage our anxiety I think
04:07	we need to spend a few moments
04:08	understanding where this anxiety comes
04:10	from I believe it's hardwired in us it's
04:14	based on evolution we are wired to be
04:18	very concerned about our relative status
04:21	to others now I'm not saying who drives
04:24	the fanciest car or who has the most
04:26	likes to a post they've just put up I'm
04:29	talking about the status that existed
04:31	when our species was first evolving and
04:33	we were hanging out in groups of about a
04:35	hundred and fifty people your relative
04:38	status there meant everything
04:41	Ament access to resources food shelter
04:44	reproduction it was absolutely critical
04:47	that you had status within that group it
04:50	was a matter of life or death
04:52	so this constant surveillance and
04:55	understanding of our status is something
04:57	that we carry forward to this day yet we
05:03	can manage it but we have to take a
05:05	two-pronged approach we have to first
05:08	address the symptoms as well as the
05:10	sources the symptoms have to do with
05:12	what goes on in our body physiologically
05:15	and what goes on in our mind
05:16	psychologically and sources are things
05:19	that actually make our anxiety worse so
05:22	let's get started for some of us when we
05:26	start communicating in high-stakes
05:27	situations we feel our heart pound maybe
05:31	we get a little shaky maybe we perspire
05:33	or blush we can manage these symptoms
05:37	take a deep breath before you start the
05:41	kind of breath you would do if you're
05:42	doing yoga or Tai Chi or Qi Gong that'll
05:45	calm you down if you shake gesture
05:49	broadly big broad gestures they can
05:52	really help that adrenalin go somewhere
05:55	most nervous people make themselves
05:58	small and tight and they hold it in and
05:59	shake if you perspire a blush hold
06:03	something cold in the palm of your hand
06:06	it'll cool you down much like putting a
06:09	cold compress on your forehead or the
06:11	back of your neck if you have a fever
06:12	holding something cold reduces your core
06:15	body temperature reduces the
06:16	perspiration reduces the blushing you've
06:19	all experienced this in Reverse on a
06:21	cold day have you ever held hot coffee
06:23	or tea and felt how it warmed you up
06:26	we're just doing the opposite there are
06:29	things you can do to manage the
06:32	physiological symptoms you have around
06:34	anxiety now what about the cognitive
06:37	symptoms the thing that makes people
06:40	really nervous
06:42	cognitively is their own anxiety it
06:45	works something like this you're sitting
06:48	in a meeting and your turn is about to
06:50	come up and as you're sitting there you
06:52	start getting a little shaky you might
06:54	have some
06:54	beads of perspiration on your brow and
06:56	you start thinking to yourself oh my
06:58	goodness this is really important I
06:59	should have prepared more I can't
07:01	believe I'm in this situation why am I
07:03	doing this I'm not my colleague this
07:04	sucks
07:06	that's your anxiety making you more
07:10	nervous there is a way that you can
07:13	short-circuit this instead of running
07:16	away from your anxiety greet it say to
07:20	yourself this is me feeling nervous it
07:23	makes sense that I'm nervous I'm about
07:25	to do something of consequence and
07:26	importance and by giving yourself
07:28	permission to feel anxious you actually
07:32	give yourself a sense of agency you can
07:35	take a breath walk around the building
07:37	this will help you feel composed rather
07:41	than as if your anxiety is spiraling out
07:43	of control we can do things that manage
07:48	our physiological and psychological
07:50	symptoms but we also have to address the
07:55	things that make our anxiety worse the
07:57	sources the number one fear I hear from
08:00	people is I'm afraid I'm going to forget
08:03	I'm gonna blank out a great way to
08:06	manage this is to have a map you can't
08:10	get lost if you have a map a map is
08:12	nothing more in communication than a
08:14	plan a structure a design there are many
08:17	structures that can help you with your
08:19	communication my favorite is the what so
08:23	what now what structure you start by
08:27	talking about what it is you're
08:29	communicating could be your idea your
08:31	plan your product a process you then
08:34	explain why it's important to your
08:36	audience how do they value from what
08:39	you're saying and then finally you
08:42	explain what is next what comes
08:45	afterwards by having a structure like
08:47	what so what now what you are less
08:50	likely to forget and by the way it helps
08:53	the people you're speaking to remember
08:55	what you're saying as well now another
08:58	big accelerant to anxiety has to do with
09:03	the valuation in judgment we feel the
09:06	audience is doing on us
09:07	a great way to manage this is to
09:10	redirect their attention have them focus
09:12	on something else so if you're giving a
09:15	presentation show a video clip take a
09:17	poll if you're in interpersonal
09:20	communication ask a question pass around
09:23	a hand out these distract people from
09:26	paying attention to you
09:27	it gives you an opportunity to calm down
09:29	and the cool thing is it gets them more
09:32	involved and engaged it's a true win-win
09:36	the last source I'd like to talk about
09:38	has to do with how we see our
09:41	communication raise your hand if you
09:44	have done one of these four things
09:45	before in your life has anybody done any
09:47	singing dancing acting or played a sport
09:50	everybody in each of those activities
09:53	there's a right way and a wrong way to
09:55	do it you're performing if you're an
09:57	actor and you miss speak your line at
09:59	the wrong time in the wrong place you've
10:01	made a mistake not just for you but the
10:02	audience and the other actors if you're
10:05	an athlete and you don't do what your
10:07	sport requires at the right time in the
10:09	right way you've done it wrong in fact
10:11	some sports keep track of the errors you
10:14	make we carry this mentality of right or
10:18	wrong into our communication I am here
10:21	to tell you as somebody who has been
10:23	doing this for a long long time there is
10:25	no right way to communicate there are
10:28	better ways in worse ways certainly but
10:30	no one right way so we need to replace
10:32	the way we see communication as a
10:35	performance as something else and I'd
10:37	like to suggest we need to reframe it as
10:39	a conversation how do you do that first
10:45	and foremost put your attention on your
10:48	audience you're in service of their
10:50	needs with this audience centric
10:52	approach it makes it more conversational
10:55	second use conversational language words
10:59	like us you and we that involves people
11:02	and finally ask questions questions by
11:07	their very nature are conversations
11:09	there to weigh in so doing you make the
11:13	interaction less stressful for you and
11:16	more engaging for your audience
11:20	so taken together there are things that
11:22	we can do to manage our anxiety by
11:26	addressing both symptoms and sources now
11:30	this isn't necessarily easy it takes
11:32	time it takes persistence we're fighting
11:35	against ingrained anxiety and years of
11:38	learned behaviors and habits but with a
11:42	little self kindness in patience we can
11:45	learn to manage our anxiety I see it
11:48	happen all the time let me share a story
11:51	with you
11:52	I met Erma who is a 72 year old
11:55	grandmother a couple years ago Burma
11:59	like me had a very traumatic experience
12:01	in high school she contributed some
12:04	comment in class and her English teacher
12:06	looked at her and said that is the
12:08	absolute worst communication I have ever
12:10	heard
12:11	from that moment on Burma actively
12:15	avoided communicating with others so
12:17	much so that she chose the profession as
12:19	a research librarian specifically so she
12:22	wouldn't have to talk to many people but
12:25	one day her granddaughter who she loved
12:27	very much asked her to give a toast at
12:31	her wedding
12:32	Burma wanted to fulfill this request and
12:35	that's where our paths crossed I'll
12:38	never forget the look on Irma's face
12:41	when she told me of her goal it was a
12:43	combination of sheer terror and complete
12:47	determination now I am thrilled to share
12:50	with you that Burma after three months
12:54	of hard work and a little encouragement
12:56	gave an amazing toast the joy on her
12:59	face is something that I will never
13:01	forget like Burma we all can learn to
13:06	manage our anxiety regardless of if
13:09	you're presenting at a wedding or in a
13:10	meeting if you're pitching or protesting
13:13	you can learn to feel more confident
13:16	when you communicate and we all benefit
13:18	from the stories you're going to share
13:21	the input you're going to give and the
13:24	ideas that you're going to spread I so
13:27	look forward to your speaking up without
13:31	freaking out
13:32	thank you
13:33	[Applause]
