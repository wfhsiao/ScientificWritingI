00:17 phrases that you should know so let's go
00:20 do you have any recommendations the
00:23 first phrase is do you have any
00:24 recommendations this is great to use
00:26 when you get to a restaurant where you
00:28 don't know what the food is you don't
00:30 know anything about the local cuisine or
00:32 you're just feeling a little bit
00:33 adventurous you can ask the waitstaff
00:35 do you have any recommendations how much
00:38 is this how much is this this is useful
00:40 when you're out shopping or when you're
00:41 in a restaurant and the price is not
00:43 clearly marked or something is not clear
00:45 to you so you can ask how much is this
00:49 usually when you point to something I
00:51 would recommend like pointing to the
00:53 menu are pointing to an item how much is
00:55 this
00:56 I'd like this you can point to something
00:58 and say I'd like this if you want to say
01:01 I'd like one for example I don't know
01:04 you're getting beer I'd like one of
01:06 these if however you're in a situation
01:09 where you can't point you can say I'd
01:11 like ten of the blah blah blah I'd like
01:14 ten of blue t-shirts please can I try
01:17 this on is useful when you're shopping
01:20 for clothes so you find something that
01:22 you'd like to try just ask the staff can
01:25 I try this on you can just say I want to
01:27 try this on if you like do you speak
01:30 English
01:30 you might get asked this phrase so you
01:33 should say if you're watching this video
01:34 you should probably say yes or you can
01:36 say yes a little if you're not feeling
01:38 very confident if you're watching this
01:40 video and you're understanding this part
01:41 and you say no things that's a little
01:45 strange I have a reservation
01:47 usually the staff will greet you and you
01:49 can say I have a reservation hello I
01:52 have a reservation it's at seven o'clock
01:54 the name is Alisha usually we say the
01:57 name is or it's under meaning the
02:00 reservation is under my name or it's for
02:04 name or it's in name water please
02:09 depending on which country are from
02:10 water may or
02:11 may not automatically be brought to your
02:13 table when you're in a restaurant if you
02:16 would like more water however you can
02:17 say water please
02:19 to make it a little more polite I would
02:21 like wave at the waitstaff and say could
02:24 I please have some more water do you
02:26 take credit cards do you take credit
02:28 cards in case you're not sure if the
02:30 shop that you're in will accept credit
02:32 cards or debit cards you can ask them do
02:35 you take credit cards
02:36 it's so it doesn't mean do you take
02:38 meaning are you going to take my card
02:40 but this take means do you accept credit
02:43 cards this isn't what I ordered so if
02:45 you're at a restaurant you order steak
02:47 and you get lobster instead you can look
02:49 at it and go oh this isn't what I
02:51 ordered
02:52 be careful though say this politely if
02:55 you look at the waitstaff and you say
02:57 this isn't what I ordered they're gonna
02:59 be like I don't know just be a nice
03:02 customer excuse me but I don't think
03:05 this is what I ordered or this isn't
03:06 what I ordered can you please check
03:08 could we have the menu please if for
03:11 some reason you don't receive a menu
03:13 when you come to the table you can again
03:16 just wave it a member of the staff and
03:18 say could we have the menu please could
03:21 you give me a discount could you give me
03:23 a discount means I would like a cheaper
03:26 price
03:26 essentially it depends on which country
03:28 you're in if haggling or bargaining
03:30 meaning talking to the seller to try to
03:33 reduce the price my family didn't
03:35 bargain we didn't haggle so I don't
03:37 haggle it depends on you and your
03:39 culture but just yeah just be be aware
03:41 of the culture that you're in and the
03:43 place that you're in before you ask this
03:45 question do you have any vegetarian
03:47 dishes ah this is useful some people
03:50 have specific eating requirements or
03:53 eating needs maybe food allergies for
03:55 example you can replace vegetarian with
03:58 the specific dietary requirement that
04:00 you have do you have any vegan dishes do
04:03 you have any gluten-free dishes do you
04:05 have any low-fat dishes do you have any
04:07 low-carb dishes do you have any fish
04:09 free dishes do you have any could you
04:13 take a picture of me please if you are
04:15 in a location where you would like to
04:17 take a picture but you don't want to do
04:19 a selfie or you don't have a selfie
04:21 stick or whatever you want someone else
04:24 to take a picture of you astray
04:25 which you don't know you can ask them
04:28 could you take a picture of me please or
04:30 excuse me would you mind taking a
04:32 picture of me please
04:34 I'm allergic to blah blah blah if you
04:36 have a food allergy or even an allergy
04:40 to a medicine this is the phrase you can
04:42 use to explain that I'm allergic to
04:44 wheat or I can't eat wheat for example
04:48 is the Wi-Fi free meaning can I use the
04:51 Wi-Fi free of charge
04:53 keep in mind some places have a password
04:56 that you have to ask the staff for so
04:59 you can say is the Wi-Fi free if they
05:01 say yes you can then follow that up with
05:04 can I have the password I'd like to have
05:07 a non-smoking seat please so when you go
05:09 to a restaurant you have an option
05:11 between smoking and non-smoking sections
05:13 the staff will say smoking or
05:15 non-smoking you can say I'd like to have
05:17 a non-smoking seat please quite honestly
05:20 though the most natural response is just
05:22 to say non-smoking could I get a map
05:25 maybe it's a map of the subway system
05:27 for the city that you're in or maybe
05:29 it's a map of the area around your hotel
05:32 you could say could I have a map as well
05:35 could I have the check you're finished
05:37 it's your cafe you're finished at the
05:38 restaurant and it's time to leave it's
05:40 time to pay so you say to the waitstaff
05:42 excuse me could I have the check another
05:45 more common expression perhaps is excuse
05:47 me check please
05:49 you might also hear bill excuse me can I
05:51 have the bill where is the bathroom
05:54 very important question if you're
05:55 traveling in America we don't really use
05:57 the word toilet or washroom very much we
06:00 use bathroom or restroom to talk about
06:02 toilet facilities excuse me can you tell
06:06 me where the bathroom is or excuse me
06:08 I'm looking for the bathroom or I'm
06:10 looking for the restroom is this the
06:12 train for blah blah blah or is this the
06:15 train that goes to blah blah blah to
06:18 confirm with someone that I'm indeed on
06:21 the correct train line if I say is this
06:23 the train bound for San Francisco you
06:26 can use that to check if you're correct
06:28 ten compliments that you always want to
06:30 hear let's go I love your cooking this
06:34 is my personal favorite compliment oh my
06:37 god I love cooking like I'm all
06:39 posting like pictures of things that I
06:41 cooked on Twitter I'm just like crazy
06:43 about food so this would be a compliment
06:46 that I would love to get like the
06:47 ultimate compliment for me that would be
06:49 will you make my birthday cake that
06:51 would be such a compliment like it's a
06:53 question but it's it there's so much
06:56 behind that will you make my birthday
06:57 cake you would give that to me so maybe
07:01 after you can use this after a meal for
07:03 example I love your cooking and the
07:05 other person will be like next is great
07:10 job great job this is a compliment that
07:13 you can use anytime you can use it to
07:16 your with your friend with your not with
07:18 your boss your boss might use it with
07:20 you an employee a co-worker or colleague
07:23 pet even whatever it's it's just a very
07:27 small scale very easy to use compliment
07:30 it means you think whatever has just
07:32 happened is good I use great job all the
07:34 time I use great job and I use a good
07:37 job sometimes when I make a mistake or
07:40 something funny happens and I'm alone at
07:42 my house and I want to make fun of
07:44 myself I'll be like yeah great job
07:45 Alicia but if I'm if I'm trying to be
07:49 positive about a failure or laugh at
07:51 myself of it but in general it's just a
07:54 good easy compliment to give someone
07:56 great job you have a way with words you
08:00 have a way with words this can be
08:01 speaking this can be writing it means
08:05 you think that the other person is a
08:07 good communicator or maybe even more so
08:09 than just a good communicator you think
08:12 that the way they speak or the way that
08:14 they write is particularly good so that
08:17 could mean funny it could mean romantic
08:19 it could mean dramatic something about
08:22 the way they speak or the way that they
08:23 write you really enjoy that you can say
08:26 you have a way with words it's quite a
08:29 nice compliment I think it's kind of
08:30 like a you know it's smart it's a bit of
08:32 a smart thing you have a way with words
08:34 or you can say you're good with words
08:36 you're really good with words
08:38 yeah all right next one you look
08:40 gorgeous
08:41 you look gorgeous very nice compliment
08:43 to give just be very careful with the
08:45 way that you say this for an everyday
08:47 compliment I tend not to say you look
08:51 nice or you look gorgeous
08:53 today or something like that because the
08:55 underlying comment there is on the other
08:58 days that person doesn't look nice like
09:00 so if I want to compliment someone's
09:03 appearance I try to pick a specific
09:05 thing I'm like oh I've never seen you
09:08 wear that sweater before it looks nice
09:10 on you
09:11 something like that like yesterday my
09:12 friend had a new dress on and like is
09:15 that a new dress and because I thought
09:17 she looked nice but I didn't I didn't
09:19 want to make it sound like I don't think
09:21 she looks nice every day so I said is
09:23 that a new dress and she goes yeah and I
09:25 said I think that color is really really
09:27 nice on you it looks really good and she
09:29 was so happy about that so yes there
09:32 there are these compliments like you
09:34 look nice you look great you look
09:35 gorgeous and so on but I personally kind
09:38 of prefer to level them up a little bit
09:40 and just say pick a specific thing like
09:42 did you get a new haircut did you dye
09:44 your hair or you did you get something
09:46 did something happen like what whatever
09:48 it is try to pick up on a specific thing
09:50 because then that shows you're paying
09:52 attention to the other person and you
09:54 think that whatever they have chosen to
09:56 do whatever like clothing or whatever
09:58 haircut whatever it is you think that
10:00 they have good sense there too or good
10:02 style so it's kind of like a double
10:03 that's a very subtle double compliment
10:05 yeah the next word is you have good
10:09 tastes you have good taste this can be
10:11 for food fashion style for decorating
10:16 sense music in movies whatever if you
10:20 think that that person's artistic
10:23 selection is in whatever capacity if you
10:26 think that that person makes good
10:27 choices with their their appearance or
10:31 their hobbies or whatever you can say
10:33 you have good taste this is a fairly
10:35 sophisticated compliment I think we use
10:38 you have good taste for something like
10:40 it's it sounds a bit more sophisticated
10:42 maybe if you both choose the same bottle
10:45 of wine perhaps like it has kind of a
10:47 more formal adult dish sophisticated
10:51 feeling about it this compliment so yeah
10:54 maybe maybe wine is a good example of
10:56 that yeah oh nice bottle choice like I
10:59 really like that you have good taste you
11:01 can follow this by the way you have good
11:03 taste in blah blah blah you have good
11:06 taste in movies
11:07 you have good taste in music if you want
11:09 to be specific about something that you
11:11 think that person is really good at
11:13 choosing you have good taste in now okay
11:16 okay um next one is you have a great
11:21 sense of humor you have a great sense of
11:23 humor this is the this is the underlying
11:25 compliment in the phrase you are so
11:27 funny
11:27 this is the underlying compliment you
11:30 have a great sense of humor means the
11:32 other person thinks you are funny that
11:33 you are good at telling jokes or you
11:35 make them laugh this is actually one of
11:38 my favorite compliments to get you have
11:39 a great sense of humor yeah because I
11:43 think that like you know people like to
11:45 laugh so it's an it's an if someone
11:48 makes you laugh you can say this you
11:49 have a great sense of humor or you're
11:51 very funny yeah it's a good one
11:53 it's a really good one so you can say
11:56 after a joke for example or after maybe
11:59 you've you're you finished laughing it's
12:01 something the other person has said you
12:03 can say ah you have a great sense of
12:05 humor good next one is your resume is
12:08 impressive this is a weird compliment to
12:12 say to your friends unless you're like
12:15 reviewing your friends or resume it's a
12:17 bit weird this is something that perhaps
12:19 someone interviewing another person for
12:22 a job would say the candidate comes in
12:25 for the interview the interviewer says
12:27 wow your resume is very impressive I'd
12:30 like to ask you a few questions about it
12:31 so this is good to hear in a work
12:35 situation yeah you really probably won't
12:38 need to use this with your friends if
12:40 you do it's kind of weird
12:42 oh wow this next one is quite a
12:46 compliment
12:47 nobody's ever says this yeah to be fair
12:51 if somebody said this next one to me I
12:52 would feel a little bit of like pressure
12:54 the compliment here is you make me want
12:56 to be a better person this is something
12:58 that I think you see in movies from time
13:00 to time yeah I've had I had one person
13:03 say like like oh that something you did
13:06 inspired me and that was like really
13:08 like wow that was really exciting like
13:10 somebody was inspired by something like
13:11 wow that's great I want to be like you
13:14 that's a really cool compliment but if
13:16 someone says you want to make me be a
13:18 better person it's like oh wow
13:20 like
13:20 that means I'm really important to that
13:22 person which is really flattering but at
13:25 the same time if someone said that I
13:27 would also be like if it's like my
13:30 friend I would be like but I want you to
13:33 be you like I think you're a cool person
13:35 already yeah it's like oh you make me
13:37 want to be a better person like in that
13:39 person's viewpoint you're like somehow
13:41 above them and that's uncomfortable yeah
13:43 just I would rather say you inspire me I
13:47 think that that are like this thing that
13:49 you did really inspired me like if
13:50 somebody said like I saw that picture
13:52 that she posted on Twitter of that pizza
13:54 today Alicia and it really inspired me
13:55 and I made my own pizza I'd be like yay
13:58 Oh next one is nice actually I say this
14:03 to my friends quite a bit you are an
14:05 awesome friend this is really really
14:07 good to use after your friend has helped
14:10 you with something maybe you're moving
14:12 to a new apartment or new house or maybe
14:14 you've had some trouble and your friend
14:16 gave you some good advice or your friend
14:18 just listens to you when you really
14:19 needed to talk to someone after that
14:22 experience you could say thanks so much
14:24 you were an awesome friend or maybe your
14:27 friend did something really really cool
14:29 and you just want to like tell them like
14:31 I think you're really awesome just say
14:33 you are an awesome friend they'll be
14:35 happy to hear that or just you can
14:36 abbreviate it - you are awesome not just
14:38 you're an awesome friend just you are
14:40 awesome you're a cool person you are
14:41 awesome you're fantastic you are an
14:44 awesome
14:45 you're an awesome ten ways to motivate
14:48 yourself when learning English let's go
14:50 the first way to motivate yourself is to
14:52 imagine that one day you will live in
14:55 the United States so to do this imagine
14:57 what is your day going to be like when
14:59 you live in the u.s. where will you go
15:01 who will you meet where will you shop
15:03 and so on
15:04 imagine your day in the United States
15:07 okay the second way to motivate yourself
15:10 when you're studying English is to study
15:13 other aspects of the culture - which
15:15 makes it more rewarding to study English
15:17 okay so this means of course studying
15:19 English as a language but if there's a
15:22 specific country that you would like to
15:23 visit or a specific part of that
15:25 country's culture try to learn about
15:28 that - if you like music if you like the
15:31 food if you like the history try to find
15:34 something of
15:34 about a specific country or a specific
15:37 part of that country's culture that you
15:39 enjoy in addition to studying the
15:41 language okay way number three to
15:44 motivate yourself is finding funny words
15:47 in English okay so finding a word that
15:49 sounds funny or a word that you enjoy
15:51 using or a phrase that you enjoy using
15:54 can really increase your motivation for
15:56 using that word and for interacting with
15:59 people so if you can find those phrases
16:01 that you think are funny or are fun they
16:03 can be really really helpful for you as
16:05 you learn your language the next way to
16:07 motivate yourself is to make friends
16:09 with people who speak English so of
16:12 course if you don't have any friends who
16:14 are English speakers especially native
16:16 English speakers it's a really good idea
16:18 to make some friends
16:20 this way you can practice with them you
16:22 can learn from them and you can just see
16:24 maybe what their life is like and how
16:26 their life is different from yours so
16:28 this is a great way to practice a great
16:30 way to learn and a great way to think
16:32 more internationally as well the next
16:35 way to motivate yourself is watching
16:37 YouTube videos of other people who have
16:40 successfully learned English so you can
16:43 listen to people what worked for them
16:45 how did they study where did they go
16:47 what materials did they use what did
16:50 they find
16:51 not helpful so you can try to find a
16:54 strategy that works well for you through
16:57 using resources like YouTube for example
17:00 it's a great way to find people that
17:03 maybe match with what you need okay
17:05 the next way to motivate yourself is by
17:09 watching English movies and TV shows and
17:11 enjoying the feeling when you can
17:13 understand a word or a sentence yeah I
17:15 do this too when you enjoy something
17:19 when you find entertainment value in
17:21 something like music movies TV and you
17:24 there's that moment when you pick up or
17:27 when you understand what your favorite
17:29 character said or you understand it like
17:31 a key point in the story it's a really
17:33 really good feeling it makes you want to
17:36 continue watching I think so that's a
17:39 really really nice feeling I think and
17:41 you can do that by enjoying media so
17:44 it's a fun way to learn and it's a fun
17:46 feeling to experience
17:47 okay the next way to motivate yourself
17:50 is by reading English news articles
17:53 blogs and magazines to get a feel for
17:55 formal and casual language so the style
17:58 that we use here like an English class
17:59 101 and this on the videos on this
18:03 channel is quite casual most of the time
18:06 or at least in these videos it's very
18:08 casual
18:09 but the way that I speak in the way a
18:10 newspaper is written the way a magazine
18:13 is written the way a a newscaster
18:16 presents the information these are all
18:18 different ways of communicating we're
18:20 using the same language yes but there
18:22 are different styles so it's important
18:24 to try to understand those differences
18:26 and to become familiar with them so try
18:30 to find a few different things that you
18:32 can enjoy the next way to motivate
18:34 yourself is after dinner you write about
18:37 your day in a journal in English okay
18:41 this is an interesting idea so just take
18:43 a few minutes after dinner or before you
18:45 go to bed to write something in English
18:48 about what you did that day or maybe so
18:50 you have a chance to talk about future
18:52 tense or to use the future tense you can
18:55 use you can talk about your upcoming
18:57 plans or the things you're going to do
18:59 the next day so you can talk about past
19:01 tense what you did that day maybe
19:04 present tense how you're feeling as
19:06 you're writing your journal for the day
19:07 and future tense to talk about your
19:10 upcoming plan so journaling can be a
19:12 really effective exercise for motivating
19:14 you okay the next way to motivate
19:17 yourself inspire practicing with
19:18 flashcards of useful words and phrases
19:21 for 15 minutes every day on the train I
19:23 actually do do this I use but I use an
19:27 application to study in Japanese to
19:29 study kanji and 15 minutes every day
19:31 adds up over the course of a week you
19:34 can learn a lot of information in a
19:36 short period of time and if you live in
19:40 the country where your target language
19:42 is spoken then you might even find the
19:46 word you studied on the train you see it
19:48 like after you leave the train you might
19:50 see that word later on in your day so
19:52 you can immediate
19:53 we feel like an extra sense of
19:55 motivation by knowing that this thing
19:58 you're studying is applicable it's
20:00 something you can use right away it's a
20:02 really cool feeling so this is a tip I
20:04 honestly I use this last I make sure to
20:08 thank anyone and everyone who corrects
20:10 my English yeah I I think this is really
20:13 important because people are really nice
20:15 they don't want to correct you when you
20:17 make a mistake but sometimes people do
20:19 they're really polite about it and they
20:21 tell you the more tell you a more
20:23 natural way or they give you a
20:24 suggestion for how to improve your
20:26 English make sure you say thank you like
20:28 repeat after them and then say thank you
20:31 so that you know it's motivation for
20:33 them to tell you again in the future to
20:37 help you again in the future so make
20:39 sure to say thank you to anyone who
20:41 helps you with your English hi everybody
20:43 my name is Alisha welcome back to our
20:45 English class Channel today we're gonna
20:47 be talking about the difference between
20:48 bye and until so let's get started okay
20:54 so first we're gonna talk about bye-bye
20:57 marks a deadline for an action to finish
20:59 by marks the point where an action
21:02 completes or is replaced by another
21:04 action so really think about using by to
21:08 express a deadline something is going to
21:10 stop or you must finish an action at
21:14 this point in time so we can think about
21:17 by as marking some point in the future
21:24 so by mark some point in the future
21:27 where an action is going to finish an
21:31 action is going to be completed so in an
21:34 example sentence I have I'll be at the
21:36 office by 7:00 p.m. so in this sentence
21:40 the speaker is not at the office but
21:43 7:00 p.m. is the deadline this is the
21:47 point in time at which the speaker will
21:51 be at the office the speaker is not at
21:54 the office now but by 7:00 p.m. by the
21:58 7:00 p.m. deadline the speaker will be
22:01 at the office this will shows us this is
22:05 a future tense Express
22:06 and by shows us the deadline the point
22:10 at which that expression or the point at
22:12 which that action is going to be
22:14 completed so this is how we use by to
22:17 think about it like a deadline some
22:19 point in time at which an action will be
22:22 completed or finished okay so let's
22:25 continue on to the other grammar point
22:28 for today which is until until also has
22:32 a more casual form we can use till TI ll
22:36 or apostrophe TI l you might see both
22:40 spellings used for until til or til in
22:44 most cases it's good to use until in
22:47 casual speaking and maybe in casual
22:49 writing you can use the casual form but
22:52 until is always polite and is always
22:55 correct okay so when we use until let's
23:00 talk about when to use until we use
23:03 until to talk about a continuing
23:05 situation or a continuing state now in
23:09 the present or in the future but it's
23:12 going to change or stop so the key
23:17 difference one key difference here
23:19 perhaps is a continuing situation a
23:22 continuing state with by the nuance is a
23:26 deadline something is going to finish at
23:28 a deadline here however until gives us
23:32 the nuance of something that's
23:34 continuing something true now for
23:37 example but that may not be true in the
23:40 future until marks the point where that
23:44 action or that state is going to finish
23:46 or change
23:48 hmm okay so we can think of it rather
23:54 than as a deadline as a key point in the
23:57 future somewhere where action a
24:00 continues until a point where we use
24:06 until and then a second action begins
24:11 something is going to change at the
24:13 until point with by however we don't
24:17 have the nuance of an action changing
24:20 we only have the nuance of a deadline so
24:22 here until is used to show that
24:24 something different is going to happen
24:27 or something something will finish but
24:30 there's going to be a change after the
24:34 the until point so for example this
24:38 sentence very similar to the by example
24:41 sentence is I'll be at the office until
24:45 7 p.m. so here we have the future tense
24:49 aisle I will I will be at the office
24:52 until 7 p.m. this sentence shows us the
24:56 speaker is at the office right now
24:59 however at 7 p.m. until shows us that 7
25:05 p.m. is the point at which the situation
25:09 or this state is going to change so at 7
25:12 p.m. the speaker is probably going to
25:15 leave the office until shows us that
25:19 right here the action or the state is
25:21 going to change so please keep that in
25:24 mind
25:25 until shows you a change in something by
25:28 shows more of a deadline for an action
25:31 that is continuing so I hope that we can
25:33 practice this in a few example sentences
25:36 now okay so let's try to choose the
25:40 correct word to use in these example
25:43 sentences should we use buy or should we
25:46 use until in these cases so the first
25:49 one I have is he has to find a new job
25:52 bla bla bla March so in this case we see
25:57 a point in time we can think about it
26:01 should we use by or until here if we use
26:04 by we see that the deadline the deadline
26:09 nuance matches here he has to find a new
26:12 job by March if we use until he has to
26:16 find a new job until March there's no
26:20 information in this sentence that shows
26:23 us a hint or that gives us a hint about
26:25 how the action is going to change until
26:29 does not make sense for this question
26:31 so we should use by in the
26:33 case he has to find a new job by March
26:36 is the correct answer for this sentence
26:39 in the second sentence I'm not going to
26:42 go to bed
26:43 bla bla bla I finish this movie so in
26:46 this sentence we have at the end I
26:49 finish this movie so there's some action
26:53 maybe that's continuing here and we have
26:56 another action I'm not going to go to
26:59 bed in this case it's a negative so
27:02 there are two actions here this is a
27:04 pretty good hint that there's an action
27:07 that's going to change at some point
27:09 instead of the nuance of a deadline so
27:12 for this sentence until is the best
27:15 answer I'm not going to go to bed until
27:21 until I finish this movie this shows us
27:24 that at this point the point where I
27:26 finish the movie I'm going to go to bed
27:29 this marks the change in the continuing
27:32 state or the continuing situation so the
27:36 next sentence is they need to write
27:38 their reports la blah blah tomorrow so
27:41 this sentence there's no change in the
27:44 sentence we don't have any hints about
27:46 some kind of different action that's
27:48 going to happen instead we have maybe
27:51 what seems to be a deadline some
27:54 requirement here too so if we try to use
27:58 until it doesn't make sense there's no
28:01 changing action we can't guess about
28:04 what might happen in the future or a
28:06 change that might happen so by is the
28:09 best answer here they need to write
28:11 their reports by tomorrow tomorrow is
28:14 the deadline so we can guess that
28:17 tomorrow is the deadline here by shows
28:20 us that it's the deadline in this case
28:22 for this task alright let's take a look
28:26 at something a little bit different here
28:29 we have we can't leave the house bla bla
28:31 bla your mother calls so again there are
28:35 two situations there are two actions
28:39 involved in this sentence we have leave
28:41 the house and your mother calls makes a
28:44 phone call so because there are two
28:47 actions here we can guess that there's
28:50 some change that's going to happen so
28:53 because we learned that until marks a
28:57 change in actions we know that until is
29:00 the better answer here okay we can't
29:05 leave the house until your mother calls
29:07 would be the correct sentence here
29:09 alright so let's look at the next
29:13 sentence though this one is a tricky
29:15 sentence this one is a little bit
29:17 difficult we have I'm not going to be
29:20 there something something
29:22 8 p.m. hmm so here we have 8 p.m. at the
29:26 end of a sentence which looks like a
29:28 deadline right we have going to be there
29:33 mmm so should we use bye or until for
29:37 this sentence it's difficult because
29:39 actually both are okay for this sentence
29:42 I'm not going to be there by 8:00 p.m.
29:46 is correct and I'm not going to be there
29:50 until 8:00 p.m. is also correct
29:54 however the meanings are very different
29:57 just as we practiced in these two
30:00 sentences I'll be at the office until
30:02 I'll be at the office by 7:00 p.m. the
30:06 same is true here I'm not going to be
30:09 there by 8:00 p.m. means I'm not going
30:13 to be there at 8:00 p.m. it's not
30:16 possible for me I can't go however I'm
30:19 not going to be there until 8:00 p.m.
30:22 this sentence means after 8:00 p.m. or
30:26 beginning at 8:00 p.m. and after I'm
30:29 going to be there so please be careful
30:32 in some cases both bye and until are
30:36 correct but they change the meaning of
30:39 the sentence okay let's continue to
30:42 another example so the next example
30:45 sentence is also a little bit difficult
30:48 it's if my date doesn't arrive something
30:51 something 7:00 p.m. I'm leaving okay
30:55 so here we have we do have to
30:58 actions doesn't arrive my date doesn't
31:01 arrive a negative point and I'm leaving
31:05 so it seems like there are two actions
31:08 here however we have this 7:00 p.m. this
31:13 marks a deadline right so if my date
31:18 doesn't arrive there's some deadline
31:20 here if this is not completed something
31:26 is going to happen the person is going
31:28 to leave so in this case 7:00 p.m. is
31:31 showing a deadline so we have to use bye
31:36 if my date doesn't arrive until 7:00
31:39 p.m. we could use that but it doesn't
31:42 sound so natural so the new once again
31:46 here is of a deadline there's something
31:48 that is going to happen at 7:00 p.m.
31:51 7:00 p.m. marks the endpoint in this
31:54 situation so we use by here okay let's
31:58 go to the next pair again these are very
32:01 interesting points we have to leave the
32:04 beach but bah blah 10:00 a.m. and we
32:08 have to stay at the beach
32:10 bla bla bla 10:00 a.m. okay so these two
32:14 sentences I included because I wanted to
32:17 show the emphasis of changing actions
32:20 and continuing actions so we can see the
32:23 verbs are different here in the first
32:26 sentence we have leave so this is a
32:28 change leaving a location in the second
32:32 sentence I have stay which shows a
32:35 continuing action stay in one place so
32:38 here as you can guess then we have to
32:41 leave the beach blah blah blah 10:00
32:43 a.m. some change some deadline so we'll
32:47 use by to show our deadline in the
32:51 second sentence we have to stay at the
32:53 beach stay shows a continuing action and
32:56 then it's going to finish here so we'll
33:00 use unto we have to stay at the beach
33:02 until 10:00 a.m. this shows us a
33:06 continuing action and maybe at 10:00
33:09 we'll leave the beach all right let's go
33:14 on to the next sentence
33:16 I'm not going to travel abroad blah blah
33:18 blah
33:19 I learn English okay so here there's no
33:23 time point there's no 10 a.m. 8 p.m.
33:26 tomorrow and so on so this is a little
33:29 more complex maybe we have travel abroad
33:33 and learn English so it seems there's no
33:37 real deadline here but we have maybe a
33:41 change maybe this shows us some kind of
33:44 change learning English marks a change
33:46 so I'm not going to travel abroad until
33:50 I learn English hmm
33:54 this shows us that something different
33:56 is going to happen in the future so we
33:59 should use until to mark that change
34:01 okay our last example sentence for today
34:05 is we told him to wake up
34:07 bla bla bla 6 a.m. so once more our last
34:11 sentence may be a little bit simple but
34:14 6 a.m. shows us an action sort of this
34:17 deadline you can see a lot of these use
34:20 a time to mark a deadline for an action
34:22 so here we told him to wake up by 6 a.m.
34:27 this is the point at which something
34:29 must happen so we should use bye ok
34:35 great so those are a few examples
34:38 sentences that you can have a look at
34:40 and think about when you're trying to
34:42 decide whether to use bye or until keep
34:46 in mind however there are some cases
34:48 where both by or until are correct but
34:52 the meaning is going to change
34:54 significantly depending on the one you
34:56 use so I hope this lesson was useful for
34:59 you if you have any questions or if you
35:02 want to try to make an example sentence
35:04 using bye
35:05 or until please be sure to leave us a
35:07 comment if you liked this video - please
35:10 be sure to hit the thumbs up and
35:11 subscribe to our channel if you haven't
35:13 already thanks very much for watching
35:15 this episode and we will see you again
35:17 soon bye
35:27 ten words for connecting thoughts these
35:30 are going to be ten words that you can
35:31 use to transition between ideas very
35:34 useful in both speech and in writing
35:37 let's move also also also is a word that
35:42 you can use to add information I went to
35:46 the store this morning also I went and
35:50 got coffee that's true however however
35:54 however is used to contrast or to
35:58 contrast depending on your pronunciation
35:59 to differentiate to show a difference
36:03 between two pieces of information a good
36:05 pattern would be a however B so for
36:10 example I love to uncle Tadamon however
36:14 it is very high in calories so I don't
36:16 eat it often also true on the other hand
36:19 on the other hand on the other hand is I
36:22 feel used more commonly in speech than
36:25 it is in writing again it's used to
36:28 present like two sides to a story or two
36:31 sides to some information so for example
36:35 I'm thinking about visiting Taiwan
36:38 sometime this year but on the other hand
36:40 I'm also thinking about visiting
36:42 Thailand still so it might be common to
36:47 use still with the word like butt or
36:50 word like even though so you're saying
36:52 even though there's some other factor
36:54 like like I'm really really tired this
36:56 week or even though I have a lot of
36:58 homework to do I still want to go out
37:00 with my friends or I still want to see a
37:03 movie this weekend so there's this other
37:05 there's this thing that's maybe mix this
37:08 other action difficult to do or tough to
37:10 do or whatever but even though there's
37:14 this you still have this over here so
37:17 maybe the two are kind of used as a pair
37:19 I still want to go out later even though
37:21 I'm tired
37:22 then then yes a very useful word we use
37:27 then when telling stories a lot so for
37:31 example if I could tell a story about my
37:33 morning today when I got up I brushed my
37:36 teeth and then I cooked breakfast
37:40 I did a little bit of work then I took a
37:44 shower then I did some cooking blah blah
37:47 blah you'll often hear and then as well
37:50 and then I and then we and then you and
37:53 so on
37:54 so then it is really really useful for
37:56 sequencing so a useful word I think
37:58 besides besides so it's commonly used in
38:02 a pattern like besides that meaning
38:04 other than something else I went out
38:06 with my friends this weekend but besides
38:08 that I didn't really do much so another
38:11 way to say that sentence is I went out
38:14 with my friends this weekend but other
38:16 than that other than that activity I
38:18 didn't do very much okay meanwhile
38:22 meanwhile or you might hear the similar
38:25 expression in the meantime it means
38:28 while you're doing action a at the same
38:31 time maybe somewhere else action be is
38:35 happening this is used while telling
38:37 stories a lot so for example I was
38:41 working at my office all week last week
38:43 meanwhile my co-workers across town were
38:46 having a party without me so these two
38:51 things are happening at the same time
38:53 but maybe separate from one another
38:55 meanwhile likewise okay likewise I don't
39:01 really use this word personally myself
39:03 at all it's often used after an
39:05 introduction similar to the pleasure is
39:09 all mine in a formal situation so maybe
39:12 somebody says you know hey it was really
39:15 great to see you last weekend thanks
39:17 very much for coming to my barbecue you
39:19 can say yeah likewise it was really good
39:22 to see you in your family so likewise
39:24 means I have the same feeling or I have
39:27 the same idea it's kind of a friendly
39:30 phrase but personally I don't really use
39:32 that to transition between thoughts um I
39:35 would just use and I suppose but that's
39:40 how I would use it instead instead so so
39:44 instead it's used like instead of I want
39:47 to
39:48 a instead of B can be used to express
39:52 your plans or what you want to do I want
39:54 to have Chinese food instead of Italian
39:55 food tonight
39:56 so you're presenting two alternatives
39:58 essentially so instead of means in place
40:01 of or as a substitute for so I should
40:06 have drank a lot of water this morning
40:09 but instead I drank a lot of coffee
40:12 that's true I wanted to have dinner with
40:18 my friends this weekend instead I had
40:22 dinner at home in addition in addition
40:27 this is a really good word for more
40:29 formal situations I like to use in
40:32 addition in writing I don't really use
40:35 in addition in speaking unless I'm
40:37 trying to be very formal for some reason
40:40 similar to additionally as well so you
40:43 make a point a and point B and then when
40:46 you want to make one more point that's
40:47 related to point A and point B you can
40:49 say in addition point C so you're like
40:52 building an argument and in addition can
40:55 be used to kind of finish that argument
40:57 off a little bit our new marketing plan
41:00 worked really well last month we noticed
41:02 increased sales in product a in addition
41:06 we've gained a lot of new customers
41:08 something like that so just your your
41:10 quickly presenting a series of ideas
41:12 that are related to one another you can
41:15 use in addition to finish it off 20
41:17 words you'll need for the beach let's go
41:20 sunglasses the first word is sunglasses
41:24 sunglasses are those dark glasses that
41:26 you wear on your face when it's bright
41:28 outside in a sentence I forgot my
41:30 sunglasses hold on I forgot my
41:32 sunglasses beach beach is the place near
41:36 the ocean you might have a beach in your
41:38 city or in your country the beach is
41:41 usually visited in the summertime the
41:45 image is lots of Sun you can get a tan
41:47 you can get a sunburn but it's usually a
41:51 fun place to spend time with family and
41:53 friends in a sentence I'm going to the
41:55 beach with my friends this weekend I'm
41:57 so excited
41:57 in this sentence she walked along the
42:00 beach swimming
42:02 the next word is swimming swimming is of
42:05 course a popular activity to do at the
42:07 beach I go swimming at the beach
42:09 every summer or in this sentence be very
42:12 careful when swimming in the Pacific
42:13 Ocean might be sharks Sun Sun is that
42:18 big bright thing in the sky that will
42:20 make your skin change color if you stay
42:22 in it for too long the Sun in a sentence
42:27 the Sun is really bright let's get out
42:31 of the Sun palm tree the next word is
42:34 palm tree so palm trees are a type of
42:37 tree they're usually seen in like
42:40 tropical places like Hawaii has palm
42:42 trees any place close to the equator
42:45 then the middle line of the earth I
42:48 think that's where palm trees tend to
42:50 grow it's kind of an image of the beach
42:52 so palm trees there are a lot of palm
42:56 trees near the beach in California that
42:58 palm tree is almost 60 feet tall
43:00 seashell the next word is seashell
43:04 seashell are those little objects you
43:07 find on the beach like in the sand or in
43:09 the water in some cases they're like
43:11 shells from like clams or maybe oysters
43:15 sometimes two depending on what you
43:16 consider a seashell but if you break the
43:19 word down it's sea and shell so like
43:22 something from the ocean and the shell
43:24 are like the covering the outside of
43:26 something so usually a small creature a
43:28 small animal has lived inside the
43:30 seashell and then you can collect them
43:33 and look at them or make something from
43:35 them little kids like to collect them I
43:37 used to collect seashells when I was a
43:39 kid oh my gosh look at this example
43:41 sentence it says it's bad luck to take
43:43 seashells from the beach swimsuit
43:47 swimsuit is the clothing you wear to
43:50 swim in your swimming suit there are
43:53 men's swimsuits women's swimsuits
43:55 usually men's swimsuits are like short
43:58 sport shorts or I suppose there's the
44:00 what like speedo makes like the men's
44:02 swimsuits as well the really small ones
44:04 and then for women they have one-piece
44:07 swimsuits they have and then they have
44:09 bikini swimsuits the two-piece swimsuits
44:11 so in a sentence I hate swimsuit
44:15 shopping in this
44:16 sentence I need a new swimsuit this
44:18 summer ocean
44:19 the next word is ocean ocean is the big
44:22 blue the big water the big deep blue sea
44:27 in a sentence the ocean is so beautiful
44:30 at night in this sentence he dipped his
44:32 feet in the ocean
44:34 lifeguard lifeguard a lifeguard is a
44:37 person at the beach
44:39 life guard so someone who guards lives
44:42 if someone gets into trouble in the
44:45 water they start to drown or they start
44:47 to have trouble if there's an accident
44:48 at the beach the lifeguard at the beach
44:51 is responsible for handling that problem
44:53 so they'll call an ambulance or they
44:56 know how to do first aid to save people
44:59 so in a sentence it's important to go to
45:03 beaches where there are lifeguards
45:05 available if you need help in the
45:08 sentence there isn't a lifeguard on duty
45:10 here jetski next word is jetski a jetski
45:15 is a like a water motorcycle you can
45:17 ride around it on with your friends
45:20 alone riding jet skis is a lot of fun in
45:24 the sentence if you have a driver's
45:26 license you can drive a jetski beach
45:28 towel the next expression is beach towel
45:31 beach towel beach towel is different
45:34 from regular towel because usually beach
45:36 towels have like a bright color a bright
45:38 pattern or there are towels that you
45:41 don't mind or towels that are ok to get
45:44 sand or dirt in them usually in a towel
45:47 you use in your house you don't want to
45:48 get your towel really really dirty so a
45:51 beach towel is it's how you use only at
45:53 the beach in a sentence I bought a new
45:57 beach towel and it has a picture of a
46:00 hamburger on it in this sentence
46:02 oh no I got sand all over my beach towel
46:05 that's the point of beach tow' beach
46:07 chair the next expression is beach chair
46:10 as you can probably guess it is a chair
46:13 you use only at the beach so again this
46:16 is a chair you don't mind it's ok if it
46:19 gets dirty or sandy usually a beach
46:21 chair is easy to fold or easy to carry
46:24 too in a sentence I have a couple of
46:28 beach chair
46:29 that I'm going to bring to the barbecue
46:31 this weekend in this sentence can we use
46:34 these beach chairs sandcastle the next
46:37 word is sand castle sand castles are
46:40 usually kids make them they use like
46:42 buckets so kids will like put sand in a
46:45 bucket or like they move sand into piles
46:48 and design castles or these really
46:51 complicated mazes or something they make
46:54 things make buildings out of sand we
46:56 call those sand castles so in a sentence
46:59 my brother and I used to make sand
47:01 castles on the beach when we were kids
47:03 that's true in this sentence get the
47:06 buckets and we'll make a sand castle
47:08 cooler so cooler is a noun in this case
47:12 cooler is the place you keep your drinks
47:15 and your food it's a it looks like a
47:17 suitcase but it has a special lining
47:20 inside that keeps cold things cold so
47:24 you can put ice inside and it will keep
47:26 your food and drinks cold while you are
47:29 at the beach in the hot weather so in a
47:32 sentence
47:32 did you put a bunch of beers in the
47:35 cooler I forgot ice for the cooler tide
47:38 the next word is tide tide is the level
47:43 of the water the the level of the ocean
47:45 water at different times of day so if
47:48 you are interested in this sort of thing
47:50 you might know about high tide and low
47:53 tide high tide means the water level at
47:56 the beach is high low tide means the
47:59 water level at the beach is low so tide
48:01 is how high or low the water is in this
48:05 sentence the tide ebbed and revealed a
48:09 starfish abdomens it went away a little
48:11 bit so tide is the flow of water tan so
48:15 tan is we use it as a noun like to get a
48:19 tan in a sentence it means that your
48:22 skin turns a darker color so be careful
48:26 there are two words we use in English
48:28 tan means your skin gets a little bit
48:30 darker and we also use the word sunburn
48:33 or just burn burn means your skin gets
48:36 red it means like it's damaged it may be
48:39 your skin peels a bit so in America
48:42 anyway
48:43 the us anyway a tan is usually
48:46 considered a positive thing many people
48:48 want tan skin but sunburn where your
48:53 skin is red and damaged is bad so be
48:55 careful those are two different words we
48:57 use to talk about this the changing skin
48:59 color I got a tan last summer at the
49:02 beach in this sentence you got such a
49:04 nice tan in Florida
49:06 snorkeling the next word is snorkeling
49:09 snorkeling is really really fun
49:10 snorkeling is swimming but you have a
49:13 like a hose you have a pipe that you can
49:16 breathe through as you swim so you can
49:18 you usually put goggles you wear goggles
49:20 as you're swimming in the ocean you can
49:23 look down and see fish or you can see
49:26 things in the ocean but you can still
49:28 breathe so this is a really fun thing to
49:30 do to look at fish or just to just to
49:33 hang out and see a different point of
49:35 view I went snorkeling for the first
49:37 time maybe when I was 20 to 23 in this
49:42 sentence she bought goggles so that she
49:44 could go snorkeling in Hawaii flip flop
49:46 the next word is flip flop flip flop is
49:50 a very common beach sandal many people
49:54 like to wear flip flops in everyday life
49:56 too some people prefer not to it's up to
49:59 you like in California I know especially
50:02 in beach towns everybody just wears
50:04 flip-flops it's very comfortable so flip
50:07 flops kind of have an image of being a
50:09 little bit cheaper just very very simple
50:11 it's it's the most basic possible sandal
50:14 why are they called flip flops because I
50:17 always thought it was because of the
50:18 sound that they make sound I guess maybe
50:22 it sounds like flip flop in a sentence I
50:24 usually don't wear flip flops in the
50:26 sentence these flip flops keep breaking
50:29 sunscreen next word is sunscreen
50:32 sunscreen or you might also hear
50:34 sunblock these are products you can put
50:38 on your skin to prevent a tan or to
50:41 prevent a sunburn Sun screen so it's a
50:45 protection it's a protection against the
50:47 sunlight I just hit this screen so
50:49 sunscreen is quite important like it is
50:53 said that you should use sunscreen to
50:55 prevent to help
50:56 and skin cancer in a sentence I'm out of
50:59 sunscreen I need to buy more in this
51:01 sentence mom I don't need sunscreen
51:03 bikini the next word is bikini bikini we
51:07 talked about swimsuit a little bit
51:10 earlier but bikini is usually a swimsuit
51:13 for women and it's two pieces there's a
51:17 bottom half and an upper half and
51:18 oftentimes the the top half of the
51:21 bikini or sometimes the bottom half you
51:23 have to tie a knot or you have to latch
51:25 something I suppose if you don't tie it
51:27 carefully it can create a problem like
51:29 you could fall off so bikini it's a
51:31 popular style of something for women are
51:34 you going to wear your bikini to the
51:36 beach tomorrow
51:36 in this sentence my bikini came undone
51:39 in front of everyone it was so
51:41 embarrassing
51:42 five sentence patterns that you can use
51:44 as a beginner of English let's go the
51:48 first expression that you can use as a
51:50 beginner is personally I think that or I
51:53 would just use I think that personally
51:56 makes it sound a little bit more polite
51:58 I think you can use this to introduce an
52:01 opinion for example personally I think
52:03 that pizza is amazing personally I think
52:07 that dinosaurs would have been delicious
52:12 personally
52:13 I think that cars should be made to
52:21 enjoy with friends personally I think
52:29 that you shouldn't worry about it yes
52:31 that's probably a much more useful
52:32 sentence than dinosaurs would be the
52:35 next expression is what does blah blah
52:37 blah mean so we're here is the word you
52:40 don't know so for example what does
52:43 pasta mean what does Stegosaurus mean so
52:49 a word like Stegosaurus is a really
52:51 strange word that you probably don't
52:53 know Stegosaurus is a type of dinosaur
52:55 we're gonna marry dinosaurs I don't know
52:58 Jurassic we're at a Jurassic Adventure
53:00 at the moment so this is a pattern you
53:02 use when you don't know when you don't
53:05 know the meaning of the word and you
53:06 would like someone to explain it to you
53:08 so if you say what does
53:10 Saurus mean then someone can say oh it's
53:12 a dinosaur it's kind of like it's a sort
53:15 of short guy and it has a bunch of
53:16 spikes on its back and it has a long
53:18 tail and it gets into a fight with a
53:19 Tyrannosaurus Rex if you saw the movie
53:21 Fantasia by Disney okay
53:26 in this sentence what does complication
53:29 mean means problem okay
53:32 the next pattern you can use is can you
53:34 tell me more about bla bla bla so on a
53:38 topic that you would like more
53:39 information about you can say can you
53:42 tell me more about the soccer game last
53:44 week can you tell me more about the plan
53:47 for the party next week so something you
53:50 would like more information about you
53:52 can say can you tell me more about this
53:55 thing okay
53:56 so in a sentence can you tell me more
53:58 about your sandwich options that is a
54:03 useful sentence that is a useful
54:05 sentence okay in this sentence here we
54:08 don't have that back home can you tell
54:10 me more about it
54:11 mmm this is used to the reverse pattern
54:13 okay the next expression is if it were
54:18 up to me if it were up to me I had to
54:20 teach this in a class couple weeks ago
54:22 actually if it were up to me means if I
54:24 could make the decision if this was my
54:27 if this were my decision bla bla bla so
54:31 meaning if I could make the choice this
54:34 is what I would do but one point here is
54:37 the nuance is it is not my decision this
54:40 is not my decision
54:41 but if it were my decision I would do
54:45 bla bla bla
54:46 so for example if it were up to me every
54:49 day would be Saturday whoo but it's not
54:52 right so that's that's always the
54:56 underlying that's always the kind of
54:58 basic nuance of this phrase some this
55:02 decision is not mine okay here the
55:05 example is if it were up to me I would
55:08 take my boss to dinner
55:10 oh my things just got scandalous the
55:16 next
55:17 is I feel like blah blah blah you can
55:20 use I feel like when you introduce a
55:23 suggestion or something that you would
55:24 like to do especially for food drinks or
55:27 activities so for example I feel like
55:30 coffee
55:30 I feel like Italian food I feel like an
55:33 action movie there's some activity or
55:36 something you would like to do at the
55:38 end of this pattern
55:39 I feel like bowling this afternoon
55:42 something needs to go here some sort of
55:44 activity of course you can use this
55:47 expression to talk about your feelings I
55:50 feel like something but this something
55:53 must be a noun it must be a noun like if
55:57 you feel really great I feel like a
55:59 million bucks
56:01 for example if you feel really bad I
56:03 feel like garbage that's a nice
56:09 expression that somehow it just came out
56:11 of my head anyway you can use this in
56:13 two ways but this must be completed with
56:16 a noun phrase at the end of the sentence
56:18 and things to do in the summer in the
56:20 United States so let's go to travel
56:24 abroad to travel abroad to travel abroad
56:27 abroad means outside of your country so
56:31 meaning to travel to a place not the
56:34 United States in my case please don't
56:36 forget to in this expression so many of
56:39 my students will say this summer I'm
56:42 going Europe you need to use two before
56:45 the place you do not however need to use
56:48 two before they're so like students
56:51 sometimes will say I want to go to there
56:54 you can't do that you have to use two
56:57 before the specific name of a place
56:59 there is not a specific place so you
57:01 don't need to use to keep that one in
57:04 mind to relax at the beach to relax at
57:08 the beach ah that sounds fantastic right
57:10 now to relax at the beach you go to the
57:13 beach and you just relax there you lay
57:15 in the Sun you go swimming maybe you
57:17 drink a beer you get a tan if you would
57:20 like to do that of course some people
57:21 don't you put on sunscreen whatever it
57:24 is that you like to do at the beach you
57:26 just do that and enjoy in a sentence I
57:29 would rather read
57:30 at the beach then have a really active
57:32 vacation to learn English with English

57:58 dot-com to have a barbecue oh yeah the
58:03 next one is one of my favorite things
58:05 ever to do in summer wherever I am it's
58:08 to have a barbecue or to have a BB q is
58:11 also okay but barbecue usually BB q is
58:14 in like writing I love having barbecues
58:16 with my friends in the summer every 4th
58:18 of July my family has a big barbecue to
58:21 party all night the next expression is
58:24 to party all night to party all night
58:26 you don't it doesn't have to be summer
58:28 or in the United States to party all
58:30 night just say anyway it's a party all
58:33 night means to do something you enjoy
58:36 presumably with your friends or not I
58:39 guess I partied like all night at home I
58:41 tweeted pajamas are the best and then I
58:43 tweeted a picture of myself really
58:44 excited about a cookie and was very
58:47 embarrassed about that the next day so I
58:48 deleted it and why since I won't have
58:51 school in the morning I'm going to party
58:53 all night in a different sentence I
58:54 don't like partying all night I get
58:57 tired I always hit a wall like r.e.m
59:00 like I'm like yeah and then 3 a.m. and
59:03 I'm ready to sleep to get a tan to get a
59:06 tan to get a tan in some cultures this
59:09 is a good thing in some cultures it's
59:11 not a good thing it means to sit in the
59:13 Sun or lay in the Sun and let the Sun
59:16 change the color of your skin be careful
59:20 there's there are two expressions in
59:21 English there is one to get a tan and
59:23 another is to get a Sun burn so in u.s.
59:28 culture anyway getting a tan means like
59:30 your skin turns like a darker brown
59:32 color but when it turns red it's bad
59:35 that means you've burned your skin so
59:37 tan good burn bad so we'd have 2
59:41 separate words to
59:42 describe them in a sentence you'll find
59:44 me poolside getting a tan to go hiking
59:48 the next expression is to go hiking
59:50 so hiking means walking or trekking
59:53 usually in a mountain or in a nature
59:55 setting so in a sentence I used to go
59:58 hiking with my family every summer
60:00 that's roughly true in this sentence I'm
60:03 going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail to
60:07 work a part-time job the next expression
60:10 is to work a part-time job to work a
60:12 part-time job is very common if you're a
60:15 student especially so when you have your
60:17 summer vacation it's a chance for you to
60:20 earn a little bit of money by working at
60:22 a part-time job
60:23 in a sentence unfortunately she can't go
60:26 because she has to work at her part-time
60:28 job ah when I was a teenager I had a
60:32 part-time job at a golf course yeah
60:35 because I was on the golf team at school
60:37 very convenient
60:38 lovely experiences a plus everybody to
60:43 have fun with friends to have fun with
60:45 friends also something that you do not
60:48 need to only do in summer but which you
60:50 can do anytime we're having fun now
60:52 aren't we so to have fun with friends
60:56 it's just to enjoy time with your
60:58 friends it's great in a sentence I love
61:01 having fun with my friends whenever I
61:03 can he has fun with friends but he
61:05 doesn't do much else
61:07 to attend summer school the next one is
61:10 to attend summer school to attend summer
61:13 school usually has kind of a bad image
61:15 and I feel in you in the u.s. anyway
61:18 because it sounds like maybe you missed
61:20 something in regular school but for some
61:23 people maybe there's a special course
61:24 they want to attend or like a special
61:26 internship program or it's just
61:28 something special extra that they would
61:30 like to study in a sentence I hated
61:33 going to summer school when I was a kid
61:35 since I failed the class I'll have to
61:37 attend summer school twenty 'must no
61:40 family word so let's go mother mother is
61:43 the person who gave birth to you mother
61:45 you can say mom mother mom mama
61:48 mummy my mother has amazing cooking it's
61:51 true
61:52 father father or father is the
61:55 and who did not give birth to you but
61:57 who helped make you happen so we say
62:02 father dad daddy pop-pop my father is a
62:06 very level-headed person that's also
62:08 true sister sister is a female sibling
62:11 so my brother might say I have an older
62:14 sister anyone who is yeah
62:17 a female sibling or someone you can use
62:19 this for friends that you feel very very
62:21 close to like she's like my sister
62:23 that's fine as well
62:25 brother brother we sometimes use bro for
62:28 this I would say I have a younger
62:31 brother like sister you can use brother
62:34 for any male that you feel is similar to
62:38 a brother someone you feel very close to
62:39 so he's like a brother to me or you're
62:43 like my brother grandmother grandmother
62:46 when you put grande plus something else
62:48 it means the next generation or the the
62:52 previous generation so you have your
62:54 mother and father in this case grand
62:56 mother means your mother or your
62:58 father's mother it can be either of them
63:01 so grandmother my grandmother was born a
63:05 long time ago grandfather grandfathers
63:08 are just like grandmother your mother or
63:11 your father's father is your grandfather
63:14 my grandfather liked to play tennis
63:16 that's true uncle uncle your uncle is
63:20 either your mother or your father's
63:22 brother someone directly related to one
63:26 of your parents who is a man is your
63:28 uncle my uncle is very good with
63:31 woodworking also true aunt aunt you
63:35 might also hear aunt both of them are
63:37 correct you can say aunt or aunt an aunt
63:40 or an aunt is your mother or your
63:42 father's female sibling one of my aunts
63:45 gave me a stamp collection when I was a
63:47 little kid that's also true cousin
63:50 cousin cousin is your aunt or uncle's
63:55 children it can be on any side so
63:58 typically these people are of the same
64:00 generation as you not always but cousins
64:03 are generally about the same age at
64:04 least in my family they are it's really
64:07 fun to see all my cousins at family
64:09 barbecues nephew nephew and nephew is a
64:13 siblings male child so if you have a
64:18 brother or a sister and they have
64:19 children any male children are your
64:22 nephews nephews I don't have any nephews
64:25 nice nice nice so your brother or your
64:29 sisters female children any female
64:33 children they have you can say she's my
64:34 niece or I have two nieces
64:37 how many nieces do you have or I have a
64:39 lot of nieces wife wife so this is a
64:45 female partner that you are married to
64:48 she is my wife or how is your wife wife
64:52 is only used when you are married to
64:55 that person husband husband is a male
64:58 that someone is married to so how is
65:02 your husband this is my husband again
65:05 husband is only used when you are
65:06 married to that person parent parent
65:10 parent it's typically used generally for
65:13 a mother or a father like I'm a parent
65:15 he is my parent she is my parent it's
65:18 often used in the plural they are my
65:20 parents these are my parents my parents
65:22 are home my parents are not at home but
65:25 you can also use parent to describe
65:27 someone who raised you so maybe your
65:29 biological mother or father did not
65:32 raise you but someone else like an aunt
65:34 or an uncle or perhaps a different
65:35 figure in your community did raise you
65:37 you can say she's like a parent to me or
65:40 she had a parenting role in my life
65:43 child child child is a a small human a
65:49 small human as a child it doesn't
65:51 necessarily have to be of your family
65:54 like if you're just at the park and you
65:56 see kids running around you can say ah
65:58 look at that child you can use a child
66:01 in the singular but be careful child
66:03 changes in the plural form to children
66:06 so not child's but children one child
66:09 two children please be careful this has
66:11 an irregular plural form maybe I'll have
66:14 a child someday
66:15 son son is a male child
66:19 aim
66:20 offspring my uncle has a lot of sons
66:25 that's not true daughter daughter a
66:27 daughter is a female child I wonder if I
66:31 will ever have a daughter brother-in-law
66:33 brother-in-law so we use in law to mean
66:37 our married partners family members not
66:41 my brother but my partner's
66:43 brother-in-law is used after any family
66:46 members position or family members title
66:49 to show they belong to my partner's
66:52 family originally but now they're part
66:54 of my extended family as well I'm going
66:57 out for drinks with my brother-in-law
66:58 tomorrow night father-in-law
67:00 father-in-law so we have in-law here
67:04 meaning my partner's father
67:07 so my father-in-law is very kind
67:10 mother-in-law mother-in-law meaning my
67:13 partner's mother in a sentence my
67:15 mother-in-law and I get along really
67:17 well hi everybody my name is Alisha
67:20 today I'm going to be talking about the
67:23 simple future tense today I'm going to
67:26 talk about will and won't and going to
67:30 and not going to so these are a few
67:33 grammar points that learners make
67:35 mistakes with when should you use will
67:37 or won't when should you use going to or
67:40 not going to so I'm going to talk about
67:43 a few of these points a few basic points
67:46 that I hope can help you decide when to
67:48 use will and when to use going to so
67:51 let's begin okay the first point I want
67:55 to talk about is going to or not going
67:58 to the positive form and the negative
68:02 form going to not going to for today I
68:06 want to talk about two times when we'll
68:08 use these grammar points so the first
68:11 time the first situation where you use
68:14 going to or not going to is for plans
68:18 decided before the conversation so if
68:21 you make a decision about your future
68:23 plans or someone else makes the decision
68:27 before the conversation about their
68:29 plans for the future
68:31 you should use going to
68:33 not going to it's something that is
68:37 probably going to happen a high
68:39 certainty so this is a plan that has a
68:42 high level of certainty meaning there's
68:45 a good chance this plan is going to
68:48 happen you decided it before the
68:50 conversation meaning you've probably had
68:53 some time to plan your future to plan
68:57 your schedule a little bit so please use
69:00 going to for something you decide before
69:02 the conversation so on a timeline it
69:06 might look like this
69:07 we have past now and future here so your
69:11 plan is for the future yes but you
69:17 decided on the plan sometime before the
69:21 conversation so if this point this is
69:24 now this is your conversation you made
69:27 the plan you made the decision before
69:29 the conversation in this case use going
69:34 to I'm going to at the beginning of this
69:37 video I said I'm going to talk about
69:39 simple future tense will and going to I
69:42 decided before this video started about
69:46 my plans I decided what I was going to
69:49 talk to you about before the video
69:51 started so I used going to to introduce
69:54 that plan so please keep this in mind
69:57 okay but let's talk about will now so we
70:01 use will and won't for decisions that
70:04 are made at the moment of speaking so
70:07 keep in mind will is the positive form
70:10 won't is the negative form here so a
70:13 decision made at the moment of speaking
70:15 this is one way to use will or won't you
70:19 can use this for example at restaurants
70:22 you can use this to talk about plans you
70:25 make quickly after learning information
70:27 from a friend
70:29 keep in mind will and won't tends to
70:33 have a lower certainty there's a lower
70:36 chance the plan is going to happen
70:39 because you made the plan at the moment
70:42 of speaking going to is used for plans
70:45 made before
70:46 the conversation but will is used for a
70:49 plan made a spur-of-the-moment or a very
70:52 quick plan you've just made so that's
70:54 kind of the image is the decision you
70:56 just made use will or use won't in those
71:00 cases if you made the decision before
71:03 the conversation there's a good chance
71:05 you should use going to so to go back to
71:10 our timeline here if going to is used
71:13 for a decision you made in the past
71:15 about your future plans will is used for
71:20 a decision you make in the conversation
71:23 during the conversation the plan can be
71:26 anytime in the future but the decision
71:31 the point at which you make the decision
71:34 is the difference here one point about
71:39 this two points about this actually
71:40 first will if you've made a decision at
71:44 the moment of speaking and you therefore
71:46 should use will to communicate that
71:48 decision you can improve or you can
71:51 communicate that there's a high chance
71:54 it's going to happen with the word
71:57 probably mmm so here I'll show you this
72:05 in an example sentence in a moment but
72:08 you can use probably with will and won't
72:10 I'll probably I probably won't remember
72:13 that order though I'll probably or I
72:16 probably will or probably won't
72:20 point number two I want to mention about
72:22 both of these grammar points is to make
72:25 your pronunciation a little more natural
72:28 try shortening both of these expressions
72:30 going to shortens to gonna gon a gonna
72:35 I'm gonna I'm not gonna this sounds much
72:38 more natural at least in American
72:40 English for will and for won't when you
72:44 use will use the contracted form with
72:47 your subject for example I will becomes
72:50 aisle you will becomes you'll they will
72:53 becomes Vail using the contracted form
72:56 sounds a lot more natural and everyday
72:58 conversation
73:00 it's correct to say you will they will
73:02 but it sounds really stiff and unnatural
73:05 so please use the contracted form to
73:08 sound a bit more natural you can use the
73:11 contracted form with probably four will
73:13 I'll probably they'll probably will
73:16 probably these are all pretty good okay
73:19 so let's practice using them alright
73:22 first example sentence maybe something
73:26 something go hiking tomorrow so how do
73:29 we know is this a will sentence or a
73:32 going to sentence we have a hint here
73:35 maybe maybe so meaning there's a low
73:38 level of certainty
73:40 perhaps a low chance that this is going
73:42 to happen so let's say maybe I'll go
73:49 hiking tomorrow this is probably the
73:51 best answer maybe I'm going to while you
73:55 can communicate the idea yes it sounds
73:58 like you decided your plan before the
74:01 conversation but you're using maybe so
74:04 it doesn't quite match instead use aisle
74:07 maybe I'll go hiking tomorrow okay let's
74:10 look at the next sentence I'm mmm
74:13 there's a big hint here a grammar hint
74:15 I'm something something go to France
74:18 next year so next year this go to France
74:21 next year this is a pretty big decision
74:24 most people probably would not make this
74:28 decision at the moment of speaking so we
74:32 should use going to I'm going to go to
74:37 France next year this is the correct use
74:40 of going to in this case a decision made
74:43 before the moment of speaking and
74:45 there's a high level of certainty here
74:47 okay
74:49 let's look at the next one I decided
74:52 here's a hint
74:53 past tense decided if you watched a
74:55 different video oops I decided that I am
74:59 something something go out for dinner
75:02 I'm too tired okay so past tense this
75:06 shows us a big hint past tense decided
75:10 this implies the decision was made
75:13 before the conversation hmm so I'm
75:18 something something go out for dinner
75:20 I'm too tired here's another hint
75:23 so go out for dinner and too tired mmm
75:26 this should probably be I'm not going to
75:32 go out for dinner I'm too tired so this
75:36 person has decided hmm I'm not going to
75:39 go out for dinner we should use going to
75:42 the-
75:43 not going to because the speaker made
75:46 the decision before the conversation
75:48 happened and there's a highest level of
75:51 certainty there's a high chance that
75:53 this is going to happen so we should use
75:56 going to in this sentence okay okay so
76:01 the next sentence I included because I
76:02 think it's a really good one to remember
76:04 any time you visit a bar a restaurant
76:07 some kind of service situation you can
76:10 use this pattern specifically to make a
76:12 request for something so let's take a
76:15 look here my example sentence is I
76:18 something something have a glass of wine
76:21 please in this case maybe it's at a
76:23 restaurant or at a bar but in this case
76:27 you've just made the decision looking at
76:29 the menu looking at a catalogue looking
76:32 at something you made a decision
76:35 just then at that moment and you're
76:38 asking for that item you're asking for
76:40 that service so we'll use will I'll have
76:46 a glass of wine please
76:47 so in this example sentence I used glass
76:50 of wine to show my request to ask for a
76:54 glass of wine but if you want to use
76:56 this pattern to make a request in a
76:58 service situation just replace glass of
77:01 wine with the item or service that you
77:04 would like so for example I'll have a
77:06 beer I'll have a steak I'll have a
77:09 hamburger these are all things you can
77:11 order at a restaurant or at a bar if
77:14 you're shopping you can say I'll have
77:16 the blue one please for example so just
77:19 make your request using the same pattern
77:22 but replacing that glass of wine section
77:25 that I used in my example sentence okay
77:29 next one this one is maybe a little bit
77:33 challenging it's you're running late so
77:36 you something something have to take a
77:39 taxi to your next meeting so maybe this
77:42 is an assistant or someone supporting
77:44 another person with their schedule okay
77:48 so in the next sentence we're looking at
77:50 a situation where there's been a sudden
77:53 or quick change to a schedule someone is
77:56 running late and there's a new decision
77:58 that's made at the moment of speaking or
78:00 a new decision is made to reflect the
78:03 new situation so let's take a look
78:05 you're running late
78:07 so you'll or you will have to take a
78:13 taxi yeah you could say you're running
78:16 late so you have to take a taxi but
78:19 maybe this is a future plan something
78:22 that's going to happen in an hour from
78:24 now maybe this is something the speaker
78:28 is planning for later in the day so you
78:31 will is a nice way to use that you're
78:34 running late so you'll have to take a
78:36 taxi to the next meeting okay the last
78:41 one I want to talk about this uses
78:43 probably which I mentioned over here so
78:45 probably remember we can use probably to
78:48 sort of improve or we can use probably
78:52 to communicate a higher level of
78:54 certainty with the decision we made at
78:57 the moment of speaking so here you are
79:00 not going to the party then I probably
79:03 something something go either okay so
79:07 either is a big hint here remember we
79:10 use either to show agreement but
79:13 negative okay so in the last example
79:16 sentence for today we're going to look
79:19 at a situation where the listener has
79:22 heard some new information they use the
79:24 expression you're not going to go to the
79:26 party so they're confirming new
79:29 information they have just heard after
79:32 that they're going to make a decision
79:34 about what their plans are for the party
79:37 so let's take a look
79:39 we know that probably can be used with
79:44 will and won't and we know from then the
79:49 speaker just made this decision and we
79:53 know it's a negative with either so we
79:56 should use won't you're not going to go
80:00 to the party and I probably won't go
80:04 either
80:04 so the speaker uses won't here to show a
80:08 decision made at the moment of speaking
80:10 but the speaker also uses probably won't
80:14 to show there's a high chance that this
80:16 is going to happen there's a high chance
80:18 that this is the future plan probably
80:21 won't okay so there's a lot of
80:23 information communicated there with
80:26 small words like then and either and
80:28 probably as well so please keep this in
80:31 mind when you're trying to decide when
80:34 to use will won't going to and not going
80:37 to okay so so that's my recap of a few
80:43 useful grammar points how to talk about
80:45 your future tense plans so I'm going to
80:48 finish the lesson now I hope that you

81:15 English class 101.com thanks very much
81:17 for watching this episode and I will see
81:19 you again soon bye bye hi everybody my
81:27 name is Alisha today we're going to be
81:28 talking about simple past tense we're
81:31 going to talk about how to make simple
81:33 past tense statements in English so
81:36 let's get started okay so first let's
81:39 talk about when we should use the simple
81:42 past tense simple past tense statements
81:45 for today are for actions that started
81:48 and end
81:49 in the past so these are things that
81:51 both started or began and ended in the
81:55 past both of those must be true to use
81:58 simple past tense
82:00 the second point for today is these are
82:02 actions which happened at a specific
82:05 point in time so a specific point in
82:08 time can be yesterday it can be an hour
82:12 ago it can be last year it can be when
82:15 you were a kid all of these are a
82:18 specific point in time but the key is
82:20 that we know when the action happened so
82:24 specific point in time is point two for
82:27 this grammar point third we can use
82:31 simple past tense for repeated actions
82:34 in the past so things you did every week
82:37 or every month or every year every
82:39 summer every hour if you like but one
82:42 point about this make sure to include a
82:46 frequency indicator if you want to talk
82:48 about an action that repeated in the
82:50 past frequency indicator for example I
82:54 just mentioned a few every week every
82:56 month every year so frequency meaning
82:59 how often an indicator shows how often
83:02 you did that
83:03 so you can use repeated actions with
83:05 past tense to show let's see something
83:09 you did a lot in the past for example so
83:12 to give you a visual the past is down
83:15 here now is this point here and future
83:19 is up here when we use the simple past
83:22 tense it's an action that started and
83:25 ended in the past somewhere before
83:29 now that's one it's at a specific point
83:32 in time so this action and this action
83:35 we know when they happened it could be
83:38 this morning it could be yesterday for
83:41 example but we know when these actions
83:43 happened third we can use for a repeated
83:46 action so maybe these actions repeat but
83:50 we know when the repetition happened we
83:54 know when we repeated these actions so
83:57 it's okay to use simple past tense
84:00 to describe those okay so now we know
84:04 when we should use simple past tense we
84:07 know why we should use simple past tense
84:09 but how do we make simple past tense
84:12 statements so when you want to use the
84:15 simple past tense to explain an action
84:18 that happened in the past you need to
84:20 conjugate your verb you need to change
84:23 your verb so that means when you're
84:25 using a regular verb you do verb plus e
84:28 d so verb plus e d is the basic form for
84:33 simple past tense verbs but keep in mind
84:37 this is only for regular verbs not all
84:39 verbs are regular verbs so for example
84:42 some common ones are talk which becomes
84:44 talked start which become started and
84:48 enjoy which becomes enjoyed please be
84:51 careful however you'll notice that the
84:53 past tense form of verbs has a few
84:56 different pronunciations so for example
84:59 start becomes started it has an ID sound
85:02 it's not an e D sound but an ID sound
85:05 you might hear a word like walked also
85:09 which has a sort of T sound about it
85:11 walk becomes walked started becomes
85:14 started and ID sound and then there's
85:16 also a sound like in breathed a very
85:19 soft D sound so there are three past
85:22 tense verb sounds to listen for an e D
85:25 sound started a soft D sound like
85:28 breathed and then a more hard T sound
85:31 like walked so pay attention to that
85:34 when you're trying to make these past
85:35 tense verb conjugations okay but some
85:40 verbs are irregular verbs irregular
85:43 verbs do not have a simple rule for
85:46 understanding past tense conjugation how
85:49 to change them in past tense there's no
85:52 rule for these you simply have to
85:54 practice you have to remember them read
85:57 them listen to them until you can
86:00 remember the correct conjugation the
86:02 correct way to change these verbs into
86:04 the past tense so for example some
86:08 common ones are eat which becomes ate
86:11 speak becomes spoke
86:14 and make becomes made if you see a verb
86:18 somewhere that that seems a little odd
86:20 or you're not sure what the present
86:22 tense form would be you can check a
86:24 dictionary and try to remember it from
86:26 there so now we've talked about simple
86:29 past tense irregular and regular verbs
86:31 let's try to use them to make some
86:34 sentences I prepared a few example
86:36 sentences so let's take a look okay
86:39 first sentence he something something a
86:41 towel and sunglasses to the beach so the
86:45 verb here is bring I want to use the
86:47 verb bring bring however is an irregular
86:50 verb so I can't use the Eadie rule for
86:53 regular verbs the correct conjugation is
86:56 brought the are oh you ght he brought a
87:01 towel and sunglasses to the beach this
87:04 is the correct conjugation here so bring
87:06 is an irregular verb okay let's go to
87:10 the next sentence say something
87:11 something to the gym every day last week
87:14 so here I'm showing you a repeated
87:17 action here I'm using everyday this is a
87:20 frequency indicator how often did I do
87:22 that action and last week shows the
87:25 specific point in time so I'm using both
87:29 of these two points in addition to a
87:32 simple past the basic simple past
87:34 structure here so the verb that we want
87:37 to use here is go but go is an irregular
87:40 verb so we can't use goed for example
87:43 though changes to went in the past tense
87:46 so went is the correct answer for this
87:49 sentence here okay let's try the next
87:52 one I something something to tell my
87:55 boss about my schedule so the verb I
87:59 want to use here is forget forget is a
88:01 very useful word I think to remember but
88:05 again forget is not a regular verb
88:07 forget is an irregular verb so we cannot
88:10 use the IDI form forget in the past
88:13 tense becomes a forgot okay
88:18 so I forgot to tell my boss about my
88:21 schedule is the correct sentence here
88:23 all right let's go to something a little
88:26 bit different here's a negative sentence
88:29 I don't think they something-something a
88:32 reservation at the restaurant okay so
88:35 here I'm using a phrase I want to use
88:38 the phrase make a reservation to make a
88:40 reservation so the verb here is make
88:43 this was one of my example verbs for the
88:46 irregular form so make becomes made I
88:50 don't think they made a reservation at
88:55 the restaurant is the correct verb form
88:57 to use here all right the next sentence
89:01 we something-something junk food almost
89:03 every day last month so here again I
89:06 have everyday but I have almost here so
89:10 almost every day not every day but close
89:13 to every day and then last month last
89:16 month is my specific point in time in
89:19 this case so here we have junk food that
89:22 means that the verb we want to use is
89:24 probably eat and we learned that eat is
89:28 an irregular verb there's no rule for
89:30 conjugating this we just know that eat
89:33 becomes eight we ate junk food almost
89:36 every day last month great okay so next
89:41 sentence has two spaces for verbs
89:44 actually okay so the next sentence that
89:47 I've prepared I included because a lot
89:49 of my students asked about how to report
89:52 information when you want to report
89:54 information share something that you
89:57 heard from a friend a past tense action
90:00 you need to conjugate the reporting verb
90:03 for example say becomes said or here
90:06 becomes heard you need to conjugate this
90:09 verb and you need to conjugate the
90:11 information that you heard so there are
90:13 two past tense conjugations that should
90:16 happen when you report information let's
90:18 take a look so here we have she
90:21 something something she something
90:23 something a great time at the party
90:26 so here she blah blah blah a great time
90:30 at the party
90:31 so we use the expression to have a great
90:34 time to have a great time again have is
90:38 an irregular verb so we conjugate it to
90:41 had she had a great time at the party
90:46 okay but then to report your speech so
90:50 someone gave you information
90:53 past tense give becomes gave you
90:56 information so the verb for giving
90:59 information a neutral way to pass
91:02 information is say so to conjugate say
91:06 into the past tense it's an irregular
91:08 verb so we use said say becomes said so
91:12 she said she had a great time at the
91:17 party okay please be careful of your
91:20 pronunciation with the word said a lot
91:23 of people I've heard use Sade Sade is
91:26 not correct so please use said it sounds
91:29 like sed the pronunciation but it's said
91:33 si ID is the spelling se becomes said
91:36 she said she had a great time at the
91:39 party okay
91:40 so last one okay so the last example
91:44 sentence for today includes spaces for a
91:47 few different verbs I included this
91:49 because I wanted to show you that you
91:51 can use a lot of different information
91:53 in one sentence just by connecting your
91:56 past tense verbs together so let's take
91:58 a look okay yesterday I
92:01 something-something late
92:02 something-something shopping and
92:04 something something to my mother okay so
92:08 the verbs I want to use for this
92:10 sentence are sleep go and speak sleep go
92:15 and speak these are all irregular verbs
92:18 there are no regular verbs in this
92:20 sentence so sleep in past tense becomes
92:24 slept go in past tense becomes went and
92:30 speak in past tense becomes spoke so
92:36 here in one sentence I have I have
92:38 explained three things about my day
92:40 yesterday yesterday I slept late I went
92:44 shopping and
92:45 I spoke to my mother so you can explain
92:47 a lot of things with past tense and a
92:50 few connecting words in this case I've
92:52 just used and to connect the last two
92:55 things in this sentence so please keep
92:57 this in mind when you're sharing
92:59 information about your past events so
93:02 today we talked about the simple past
93:04 tense and we talked about how to
93:06 conjugate both regular and irregular
93:08 verbs it might seem a little bit
93:10 difficult to understand which verbs are
93:13 regular and which verbs are irregular
93:14 but with some practice it will become
93:17 easier so I hope that you enjoyed this

94:10 hi everybody my name is Alisha and today
94:13 we're gonna be talking about 15
94:14 questions that you should know so these
94:16 are 15 questions that not necessarily
94:18 you need to know how to ask them perhaps
94:21 you know some of the questions already
94:23 but you will probably also hear these
94:25 questions as well so we'll practice a
94:27 few different answers for these
94:28 questions too so let's get started do
94:32 you like American food the first
94:34 question is do you like American food
94:36 you will probably be asked this question
94:38 do you like American food you can either
94:40 say yes or no or you can give a specific
94:43 example someone says do you like
94:45 American food yes I love Philly
94:46 cheesesteaks I would recommend saying
94:49 yes or a little or or or you can just
94:54 say I don't know what do you recommend
94:55 have you been to the United States
94:58 the next question is have you been to
95:00 the United States have you been to the
95:01 United States so someone asks you have
95:03 you been to the United States you should
95:05 reply with either yes I have or no I
95:08 haven't or maybe no I haven't yet but I
95:11 want to when you want to ask someone
95:14 this question you can say have you been
95:15 to Japan have you been to Egypt have you
95:17 been to China whatever you can use your
95:20 own country when you ask this question
95:21 how are you how are you when someone
95:24 asks how are you don't say I'm fine
95:26 thank you and you please don't say that
95:29 please say something more natural like
95:31 good great I'm good how are you
95:34 something like that is much better than
95:37 I'm fine thank you and you be a little
95:39 more genuine in your reply also when you
95:41 ask this question maybe one point to
95:43 help you sound a little more natural
95:44 when you ask someone else don't like try
95:47 to say how are you how are you instead
95:49 of how are you or and make sure your
95:52 intonation is correct I've had a few
95:53 people ask me how are you like a little
95:56 too moon yeah with this question or like
95:59 how are you but how are you should be
96:03 the intonation with this how are you how
96:05 are you it's a little bit more natural
96:07 how long have you been studying English
96:09 how long have you been
96:11 studying English how long have you been
96:13 studying English great question to know
96:15 the answer to your answer should be I
96:17 have been studying English for
96:19 blah-blah-blah years or glop up on
96:21 months above what weeks but if that's
96:24 too much for you you can just use the
96:25 time how long have you been studying
96:27 English six years how long have you been
96:29 studying English two months so just pick
96:32 the time if the whole sentence is quite
96:34 long for you how old are you we don't
96:37 really go around asking people how old
96:39 they are like just the first time you
96:41 meet them necessarily especially if
96:43 they're older much older than you like
96:45 in particular it's sometimes considered
96:48 rude to ask especially women how old
96:50 they are so just be careful with this
96:51 question but if you're about the same
96:53 age group you know maybe you're at an
96:55 event or a party or something and you
96:56 just want to check how old the other
96:58 person is you can use this phrase when
97:00 you reply to this just say I'm plus the
97:03 number to make a really simple response
97:06 so how old are you I'm 15 how old are
97:08 you I'm 42 whatever the answer is just
97:11 stick I'm in front of it not i but i'm i
97:14 am but use the contracted form to sound
97:17 more natural i'm number if you want to
97:19 make a full sentence you can say i'm
97:20 number years old don't forget that s in
97:24 years i'm a million years old what did
97:28 you say what did you say if you couldn't
97:30 quite hear something that someone else
97:32 said you can use this question to
97:34 confirm sorry what did you say it's a
97:36 little nicer than just saying what what
97:39 did you say or what did you just say
97:41 sorry what did you say I couldn't hear
97:43 you
97:44 what's this what's this when you don't
97:47 know what something is what's this when
97:49 you're out for dinner you're out for
97:50 lunch or something and you find a new
97:51 food you or you just you're curious just
97:54 say what's this to reply to this
97:56 question just say it's bla bla bla
97:58 what's your name what's your name of
98:01 course you should know how to ask this
98:02 question and how to answer this question
98:04 what's your name is a little more
98:06 natural than what is your name again
98:08 contracted form will help you sound much
98:10 more natural so what's your name someone
98:13 asks you you can just give your name
98:14 Alicia that's fine you can say Alicia
98:17 you can say I'm Alicia that's fine too
98:20 you could say my name is or my name's
98:23 Alicia
98:24 either any of those are fine in a more
98:27 formal situation a business situation I
98:29 would I would use my name is Buffalo and
98:32 while I shake hands or something
98:33 what's your phone number the next one is
98:36 what's your phone number I would not ask
98:38 this question right away like maybe
98:40 you've met the person a few times but
98:42 you would like to contact them whether
98:43 it's because you're romantically
98:44 interested in them or because you want
98:46 to be better friends with them but just
98:48 if you meet someone for the first time
98:50 and you're like what's your phone number
98:52 like a little it's a little too much so
98:56 use this question after you've met the
98:58 person a few times and you know you want
99:00 to become better friends when you want
99:01 to give your phone number just say it's
99:03 and the number that's fine just it's
99:06 blah blah blah or my phone number is
99:08 blah blah blah with the number 5 5 5 1
99:11 million and 5 to 6 when is your birthday
99:14 so maybe you want to plan a birthday
99:16 party for example or it's just another
99:18 fun question the first time you meet
99:19 someone when is your birthday so when
99:21 you want to tell someone your birthday
99:23 just give the month and the date mmm
99:25 January 15th August
99:28 42nd that's a real day if you want to
99:32 make a full sentence you can say my
99:34 birthday is month date where are you
99:36 from the next word the next question is
99:39 where are you from this can refer to
99:41 your country or your city mmm but I feel
99:44 like prop more stuff and it refers to
99:45 your country so where are you from your
99:48 answer should be I'm from places I'm
99:50 from China I'm from Japan I'm from
99:53 Vietnam I'm from America
99:54 whatever I'm from there where did you
99:57 learn English the next question is where
99:59 did you learn English where did you
100:02 learn English if you're speaking great
100:04 English you can say I learned English at
100:06 the English class 101.com
100:08 yes you did because you're watching no
100:11 anyway where did you learn English in
100:14 this case in the case of like these
100:15 videos I learned English online or I
100:17 learned English from and then the school
100:20 name or the program name so I learned
100:21 English from English class 101.com for
100:24 example if you studied English at
100:25 university you can say I learned English
100:27 at university or I learned English from
100:30 my friends perhaps where do you live
100:33 where do you live depending on the
100:35 situation where you're asked this this
100:37 can mean your country
100:38 like I live in America I live in China
100:41 sometimes it's about the place in the
100:43 city where you live sometimes it's about
100:45 the country where you live so you can
100:47 kind of feel I think which question
100:49 which type of question is being asked
100:50 where do you work where do you work is
100:53 talking about your job you can use the
100:56 pattern I work at company name or I work
101:01 for company name either it's fine
101:04 I work at ABC company I work for ABC
101:07 company either is okay but you know if
101:09 if you have answered with the wrong
101:11 information the other person will just
101:12 ask you like oh I mean where is your
101:14 office or oh I mean which company do you
101:17 work for use the force for this one
101:19 where is the bathroom where is the
101:21 bathroom
101:22 very important question where is the
101:23 bathroom in American English where is
101:25 the bathroom or where is the restroom is
101:27 more common than where is the toilet
101:29 using the word toilet is a little bit
101:31 too direct in American English so I
101:33 recommend bathroom or restroom so those
101:36 are 15 questions that you should
101:37 definitely know know how to ask these
101:40 questions and know how to answer these
101:41 questions they are very useful and very
101:44 important for everyday conversation

102:01 us because you're amazing
102:07 yeah Thunderdome in my stomach that's
102:12 going at the end of my videos I'm sure
102:14 hi everybody my name is Alisha and today
102:16 I'm joined again in the studio by
102:18 Michael hello and today we're gonna be
102:21 talking about bad habits in English so
102:23 these are some things that we've heard
102:25 before or mistakes that native speakers
102:27 and non-native speakers of English make
102:29 and that drive us crazy so let us begin
102:34 you start
102:36 what's your first thing um this doesn't
102:40 bug me too much until someone points it
102:43 out about me and then it drives me nuts
102:48 yeah okay once you tell someone that
102:51 they say
102:52 um or like too much then every time they
102:56 say it they notice it and it's really
102:58 hard to get a thought out because these
102:59 are filler words that you almost always
103:01 use or I always use maybe Americans
103:03 always use but it's yeah it's really
103:05 tough not to use the word like or um I
103:08 think when you're just speaking casually
103:09 right yeah right well yeah I mean like
103:14 right now why he had remains of the
103:18 first one actually we talked about that
103:20 we have a video I think probably like a
103:23 year ago one of the English weekly words
103:25 videos where the word like was one of
103:28 the words that Americans overuse I don't
103:32 know where that information came from
103:33 but that was C oh my god now I'm
103:35 suddenly aware of it why this whole
103:39 thing I'm gonna be thinking about how
103:40 often I say liking them okay let's see
103:43 I'm gonna go to one that I think all of
103:45 us talked about and all of us were aware
103:47 of before we even turned the camera on
103:49 but this is a this one is written this
103:51 is a written problem that drives me nuts
103:53 and there are so many variations on this
103:55 with other words but this is the big one
103:57 you're why oh you are this is a do not
103:59 equal sign why oh you apostrophe re so
104:02 this one your while you are is a
104:06 possessive word this is your shirt your
104:09 bag your whatever why oh you apostrophe
104:13 re is a contracted form of you are
104:16 interestingly enough though I will say
104:18 that I rarely see non-native speakers of
104:21 English make this mistake most of the
104:23 time it's native speakers who make this
104:25 mistake come on guys really I just it
104:30 just drives me nuts
104:31 yeah that one you need drives me nuts
104:33 that one bugs me too because it's it's
104:35 really simple I mean there's another one
104:36 and it still kind of bugs me but I'm
104:39 more forgiving as it's and it's because
104:41 they're both ites and one of them has an
104:45 apostrophe and in both cases it seems
104:49 reasonable because you can use an
104:50 apostrophe for possessive or for a
104:52 contraction so both seem reasonable and
104:56 you just have to do like you know a
104:57 pneumonic device figure it out there's
104:58 rules I'm sure there's a you know
105:00 English language English class 101
105:02 episode on it you know what apostrophe
105:04 is the one that
105:05 the possessive the apostrophe s is the
105:07 one that start for it has or it is right
105:10 but it makes sense it's kind of tough
105:12 for some people to remember you are
105:15 you're in your that that really upsets
105:17 me yeah it's so easy it's simple that in
105:20 there and we talked about this earlier
105:21 there there and there the possessive th
105:25 e ir for that's their house that's their
105:28 dog th ER e it's over there and th ey
105:32 apostrophe re they are there are three
105:35 different there there there's sound the
105:37 same but they have different meanings
105:39 and they should be spelled differently
105:41 too so come on native speakers games
105:43 together okay alright next one for you
105:46 what's your next one ah along the same
105:49 lines of being like correct could of so
105:53 I think the problem with a lot of these
105:55 words is so it's supposed to be could
105:58 have but when you're speaking the
106:00 language any language you you make it
106:03 quicker and quicker and you kind of slur
106:04 the words together so like for example
106:06 grandma or grandma you like native
106:10 speakers you don't really say the deed
106:11 you say that grandma grandma and so as a
106:13 kid I thought that's how you spelled it
106:14 and I remember spelling GRA Mme
106:17 someone told me no that's not it so
106:19 could of it it makes sense why people
106:21 would say could of but it doesn't it's
106:23 not proper and you shouldn't get in the
106:24 habit of doing it I think most of these
106:26 things you can be forgiving when they're
106:27 kids but it's best to nip it in the bud
106:30 because you know it just becomes a bad
106:32 habit yeah and I mean with could have
106:36 there is a correct contracted spelled
106:38 version it's just could do apostrophe ve
106:41 could if I mean I I would argue that
106:43 it's more casual and it's perhaps not
106:45 the most correct thing to write I would
106:48 probably would just write could have I
106:50 probably wouldn't use the contracted
106:52 form so much use of contractions will
106:54 make you sound more casual if you want
106:56 to write a formal letter you should I
106:57 feel you should not use contractions if
106:59 you're writing an academic paper as well
107:01 don't use contractions spell it out
107:04 spell the whole thing out you'll sound
107:05 much more formal and more at least in my
107:07 mind more educated all right great this
107:11 topic is getting me all like antsy okay
107:15 let's see I'm gonna go to okay
107:17 another pronunciation issue that I feel
107:20 like almost is cool now okay let me ask
107:26 you a question this pronunciation okay
107:30 so I've written acts on this card but
107:33 the it's asked ASX let me ask okay so
107:37 this lemme which we talked about in a
107:39 previous video which is short for let me
107:41 I've contracted it here to the very
107:43 casual lemme but I've used lemme here
107:45 because this is this is typically said
107:47 in a very very casual setting let me ask
107:49 you a question but the pronunciation of
107:51 ask should not be acts it's asked let me
107:55 ask you a question I want to ask you
107:57 something it's not acts it's ask ask
108:01 yeah this one again so like lemme lemme
108:04 is okay I think most people say lemme I
108:06 think that's okay but for some reason
108:08 acts I think a lot of these just are not
108:10 even close at all let me when you say it
108:12 really fast it sounds like lemme let me
108:14 write but when you say acts it's just
108:18 totally wrong it's reversing the the
108:20 consonants in the word ask right it's
108:22 not faster you're not making it quicker
108:24 you're not slurring or making you know
108:26 putting it into one little like fluid
108:27 blob it's just you just switch the two
108:31 yeah absolutely I hear this with the
108:34 word asterisk as well
108:36 the little star that's on like the
108:38 number eight on your keyboard or
108:39 whatever that this looking thing it's
108:42 not an actress or what I don't even know
108:44 it's asterisk so over pronunciation so
108:48 this one is kind of the opposite
108:50 direction so this whole time we've been
108:52 kind of nitpicking when you use the
108:55 incorrect version of a word I think over
108:58 pronunciation can also be equally as
109:00 damaging but instead of making you look
109:02 stupid it makes you look pretentious so
109:03 for example we don't say in English we
109:06 don't use all of the syllables with
109:08 chocolate so it's cha like when you
109:11 spell it
109:11 chocolate white chocolate right and so
109:15 like maybe in Spanish or something like
109:17 that they would still say that like
109:18 chocolate they're something whatever but
109:19 with English we took it out and so even
109:22 though you still spell all of those
109:23 syllables native speakers now say
109:26 chocolate chocolate or like comfortable
109:29 comfort
109:31 that's how it's spelled but native
109:32 english-speakers we say comforter bull
109:35 and this is like now it's it's I think
109:38 it's like unanimous so maybe when it
109:41 becomes when slang becomes so popular
109:43 that it's part of the new language it's
109:44 the language is now evolved if you don't
109:46 go with the flow even though it's
109:48 incorrect I think you sound pretentious
109:49 that's a great one I like that a lot
109:51 alright I'm gonna wrap it up I have to
109:56 actually I'll just I think I can do them
109:57 quickly though do you have any more by
109:59 the way no no okay then I'll go quickly
110:01 these are to my last two are just a
110:04 couple that my students actually
110:05 struggle with so maybe this this is
110:08 something that you can work on as well
110:10 this one just an example sentence I want
110:13 to go to there I've underlined the word
110:14 to here we use the word to when we're
110:18 talking about a specific city or a
110:20 specific country like I want to go to
110:21 New York I want to go to Europe but
110:24 there is not a specific location I want
110:27 to go to there is not a specific place
110:30 so we you don't need to use to in this
110:32 sentence I want to go there it's
110:33 perfectly fine so this is a mistake that
110:35 non-native speakers it seems seem to
110:38 make from time to time perhaps okay and
110:42 then another one that I've heard a lot
110:44 recently is this phrase in case of and
110:48 then a country so for example in case of
110:50 China in case of Egypt or whatever where
110:54 someone is trying to explain like the
110:56 political situation or a policy in that
110:58 country in case of in case of but
111:02 actually you don't need to use case of
111:04 just in China in Europe in Japan
111:08 whatever you don't need to use case of
111:11 this pattern in case of is used for like
111:14 an emergency situation or used to talk
111:17 about alternate plans often to do with
111:20 weather so for example in case of rain
111:23 the event will be canceled or in case of
111:25 tornado please go to your nearest
111:28 evacuation center I don't know something
111:31 like that
111:31 so it's used for like an emergency
111:33 situation it's not used to talk about
111:36 policies in the countries just use in
111:38 plus the place it's much better much
111:40 more natural so those are a few things
111:42 that I've noticed that non-native
111:43 speakers
111:44 struggle with sometimes so perhaps
111:47 they'll be helpful for you as well so
111:49 thanks very much for watching if you
111:50 have a bad habit that you've noticed
111:52 when you're speaking English or if
111:54 you've noticed about habit and somebody
111:56 else in their English speaking or their
111:58 writing or whatever please leave it in a
112:00 comment and let's compare it might be
112:02 interesting to see if there are any
112:03 other things that people tend to
112:04 struggle with thanks very much for
112:06 watching this episode and we will see
112:07 you again soon bye
112:09 hi everybody my name is Alisha and today
112:12 we're gonna be talking about ten of the
112:14 hardest words to pronounce according to
112:16 you guys so we collected some
112:17 information from you on Facebook thanks
112:19 very much for sending in your ideas and
112:20 these were the top 10 most difficult
112:23 words for you to pronounce so let's get
112:25 started absolutely absolutely absolutely
112:28 might be tough to pronounce absolutely
112:31 means 100% absolutely is an agreement
112:34 phrase are you going to that music event
112:36 next week absolutely yes 100% definitely
112:39 absolutely loot like a loot Lu te big
112:46 rhyme the crime apparently means dirty
112:49 I've never heard nor used this word
112:51 before but perhaps it's difficult to
112:54 pronounce the grime the door to my
112:56 apartment was big rhymed in the storm
112:59 last week breakfast the next word is
113:02 breakfast breakfast is hard to pronounce
113:04 but that is the meaning of breakfast
113:06 you're breaking the fast so fast is a
113:08 period of time without eating and to
113:10 break means to just well in this case
113:12 breaking something it doesn't refer to
113:14 like crushing a thing but stopping
113:18 something to break the fast of the night
113:21 in other words so you're fasting during
113:23 the night you're not eating so you wake
113:24 up in the morning you break the fast but
113:26 we don't say break fast we say breakfast
113:28 in a sentence this morning from
113:30 breakfast I ate a bowl of cereal with
113:33 grapes and I had a coffee too colleague
113:36 colleague
113:38 yes colleague many of my students
113:40 struggle with this they say colleague or
113:42 they say colleague you or something cuz
113:45 the spelling of this word is really
113:46 really strange there's that gue at the
113:48 end and we're more commonly I feel it's
113:50 just co-worker colleague sounds slightly
113:52 more formal to me than co-worker
113:54 somebody who you work with or somebody
113:56 who you have a business relationship
113:58 in some sense could be a person from
114:00 another company could be somebody from
114:01 your own company anyone who you do
114:03 business dealings with is your colleague
114:05 can be your colleague in a sentence I'm
114:07 going to a networking event with my
114:10 colleagues next week miscellaneous that
114:14 mis see miscellaneous so just as the
114:17 spelling I think maybe it's confusing
114:19 for this word miscellaneous
114:20 miscellaneous just means other's stuff
114:23 or just other uncatted Erised stuff I
114:26 keep a lot of miscellaneous items in a
114:28 drawer in my house maybe they don't they
114:31 don't really fit into one category like
114:33 it's not kitchen things it's not
114:35 clothing it's just sort of a mixture of
114:37 things miscellaneous things negotiation
114:41 the next word is negotiation negotiation
114:43 yeah there are two T's in this but
114:45 neither T is a hard T they're both very
114:48 soft at shish sound because they're
114:50 followed by the eye and another vowel
114:51 that she a negotiation negotiation
114:55 refers to a compromise between two
114:58 people you're trying to make a decision
114:59 and you negotiate in this case that's a
115:01 noun form negotiation business
115:03 negotiations continued for more than a
115:05 month with this important deal realm
115:08 realm I see why this one's hard it's
115:11 that rolling part the room it's a weird
115:14 word isn't it it's used to talk about
115:16 just like the kind of a fantasy world is
115:18 sort of the nuance of this phrase the
115:19 realm in a sentence lets us go to the
115:22 realm where the elves live and eat their
115:26 bread unfortunately the next word is
115:29 unfortunately unfortunately
115:31 unfortunately just means too bad you can
115:35 use this to to start bad news for
115:37 example like unfortunately I can't come
115:39 to work today because I'm sick or
115:41 unfortunately I broke my arm at the
115:44 basketball game last week or
115:45 unfortunately my haircut is bad
115:49 vocabu-larry vocabu-larry vocabu-larry
115:52 vocabu-larry vocabu-larry vocabu-larry
116:00 just refers to the words in a language
116:05 my vocabulary in my second language is
116:07 really really low I need a bigger
116:09 vocabulary so that I can express myself
116:11 more clearly
116:12 world world oh I see why this one's hard
116:16 world world hard to pronounce that are
116:19 LD I think together is tough Plus that W
116:22 at the beginning as well it's such a
116:23 short word but you have to say so many
116:25 weird things at the same time your
116:28 tongue is going like this in a sentence
116:32 I have traveled all over the world and
116:35 the best food is in my stomach that's in
116:40 so those were ten hard to pronounce
116:42 words give them a try slowly at first
116:45 and just kind of try to work up to
116:47 saying it a more natural speech if you
116:49 like thank you so much for sharing your

122:00 everybody my name is Alisha and I'm here
122:01 in the studio today with my goal hello
122:04 and today we're gonna be talking about
122:05 things that every American kid knows so
122:08 let's get right into it these are gonna
122:09 be things that we think that maybe now I
122:12 imagine most or all American kids are
122:16 aware of or have done to some degree so
122:19 let's compare why don't you start us off
122:21 oh ah this is a good one I think
122:25 everybody knows this everybody still
122:27 should know this is the magic word so
122:29 usually when you want to like get
122:31 someone to say please you're trying to
122:33 teach little kids how to be polite teach
122:37 them proper manners and so you say
122:38 what's the magic word and they say
122:40 please so like for example hey mom can I
122:42 have a cookie what's the magic word can
122:45 I have a cookie please and then you give
122:47 him the cookie yep yep it's it's better
122:49 than saying say please I feel like
122:51 saying what's the magic word is
122:53 I don't know it's kind of like a more
122:54 fun way to tell kids like people I you
122:56 know say please and thank you kind of
122:59 hypocritical to be like say please yeah
123:02 yeah yeah that's true nice nice fun okay
123:05 good all right I'll go to my first one I
123:08 picked okay you'll see in a second maybe
123:10 what I picked um let's start with let's
123:14 see I'll start with this one
123:15 I think kids probably all over the world
123:18 are aware of this one or some variation
123:19 I don't know what it's called many
123:21 different languages but hide-and-seek
123:22 hide-and-seek is a very very basic game
123:26 I mean that the game is explained pretty
123:28 much here hide-and-seek so a bunch of
123:31 kids hide and then one person usually
123:33 seeks or looks for all the other kids so
123:36 this was one of those games that you'd
123:37 play with a group of friends or even
123:39 just you know like with one of your
123:40 siblings if you don't have a whole lot
123:43 of people but the basic concept of the
123:46 game is one or more people hide and then
123:48 a few seconds later you go look for
123:51 those people I die soon that you played
123:54 this game I assume that every child
123:56 played this game hours and hours and
123:58 hours spent playing this game so I mean
124:00 there's different variations of the game
124:02 but like you have a home base usually
124:04 and so that's where the person starts
124:06 and you usually count so like what 3,100
124:09 yeah and so you close your eyes the
124:11 person who's a it and they okay one two
124:13 three and then when you are finished you
124:14 say ready or not here I come and you try
124:17 to find them and then if you are hiding
124:20 and you make it to the home base and you
124:22 touch it you're free you made it you win
124:24 yeah or like I don't know multiple
124:27 people can win it's really like a young
124:29 young kid game yeah like I don't think I
124:31 played it after 9 years old yeah I think
124:33 maybe around junior high school was
124:36 probably the last time that I played it
124:37 yeah okay uh hide and seek
124:40 yeah play hide and seek if you haven't I
124:42 don't know I bet it'd be fun as an adult
124:43 to in the right in the right situation
124:45 make it a drinking game something like
124:47 that oh you sip it so I didn't have to
124:49 fake it let's go to your next run what's
124:52 your next one um I guess talking about
124:55 games thumb war no more so I think most
125:00 people do this around the world they
125:01 they know the thumb war which is like
125:03 like this and you
125:05 you try to catch him but the thing that
125:07 not everyone knows is and I think every
125:10 American kid knows is you say 1 2 3 4 I
125:14 declare a thumb war
125:15 ready go did you not have already go I
125:18 don't remember that last part ready go
125:20 okay and then you try to get him so yeah
125:22 you tried that you try to fight it you
125:24 keep the other person's thumb down hmm
125:26 in retrospect that's not a very good
125:28 game is it nah yeah these are all
125:30 durable game yeah yeah I did it too
125:34 though I did it but like people would
125:37 always people would always kind of like
125:38 get a little bit too into it and then
125:40 they'd sort of like kind of try and rip
125:41 their hands out of it or do you use this
125:44 finger you cheat what does that call the
125:45 hook like no hooks I'm not aware of this
125:47 like this you do that and then you use
125:50 this finger so you're trying to do it
125:51 it's hard and then you ha you just cheat
125:54 basically so yeah stupid game for little
125:56 kids basically there's like it's like
125:57 tic-tac-toe you can play it like a
125:58 million times and usually you get a tie
126:01 it's just like something to do when the
126:03 teachers talking and it's just easy you
126:05 don't need a ball you just kind of like
126:06 okay let's play some terrible childhood
126:09 yeah it's pretty bad all right I'm gonna
126:13 go to my next one another game I picked
126:16 duck-duck-goose
126:18 yes yeah as I was writing this card I
126:23 was thinking to myself why is it called
126:25 duck-duck-goose of all things okay so
126:26 the game is very very simple I think you
126:29 need you need a group of people for this
126:30 one though but you form a ring a ring of
126:33 children usually and then there's one
126:35 person who walks around the outside of
126:36 the ring and they touch each each person
126:39 on the head as they walk by and say duck
126:41 Duck Duck and then randomly this one
126:44 person will select one child and say
126:47 goose you're the goose and so if you are
126:49 chosen as the goose you have to get up
126:51 and chase the other person around the
126:54 circle and try to get back to your the
126:57 place where you were sitting down before
126:59 them know you have to tag them right the
127:02 the person who was going duck Duck Duck
127:05 and then goose they try to run around
127:07 the circle and steal your spot right and
127:09 you if you're fast enough you can run
127:11 around and if you tag them then they
127:12 keep going and you're and you get your
127:14 spots too right right so it's it's it's
127:16 like a seeded version of tag
127:18 but I don't know why we call it
127:19 duck-duck-goose yeah no clue I don't
127:22 know okay so this one is actually I
127:25 think it's like from Scotland or
127:28 something I don't know I forgot I looked
127:29 it up but eeny meeny miny moe so usually
127:33 when you're trying to decide who let's
127:35 say you want to play hide-and-seek and
127:37 you don't know who's gonna be the one
127:39 who's it so then you'll go eenie meenie
127:41 miney mo catch a tiger by his toe if he
127:45 hollers make him pay a thousand dollars
127:49 every day okay you're it and there's a
127:51 few variations of that pretty much
127:54 everyone knows that I still use it to
127:55 this day
127:56 honestly any money most people shorten
127:59 it though because the tiger the whole
128:00 tiger thing is quite long so I think
128:02 eeny meeny miny moe it's just a rhyme to
128:04 choose someone I mean you could flip a
128:06 coin or do you like rock paper scissors
128:08 or something like that but for whatever
128:10 reason we do this any meenie miney mo a
128:12 thing did you ever do nose goes uh as a
128:16 child no as an adult for a drinking game
128:19 yes all the things that were like
128:23 children's games become adult drinking
128:24 game then you go up slowly get per very
128:27 very mature okay my last one is truth or
128:31 dare perhaps this is more for like
128:36 junior high school and high school age
128:38 when you start getting a little bit more
128:40 like curious is maybe the right word so
128:45 the game is you have there are two
128:47 choices that you can make this game
128:48 truth where your friends will ask you a
128:50 question and you have to reply with the
128:53 truth to that question so usually truth
128:55 is like who's who's the person that you
128:57 like or do you want a boyfriend or do
128:59 you want a girlfriend usually it's
129:00 something like that if you don't choose
129:02 truth then you have to choose dare so
129:04 dare is the choice where your friends
129:07 get to tell you to do something and it's
129:09 usually something crazy so you either
129:12 have the option of being in other words
129:14 humiliated by sharing something secret
129:17 or humiliated by doing something
129:18 embarrassing it's a it's a fun game of
129:21 humiliation to play with your friends I
129:25 I actually have some good memories
129:26 playing this game nothing nothing like
129:28 bad really just really really silly
129:30 stuff actually
129:31 like singing weird songs in front of
129:33 like my a my friend's parents that kind
129:35 of thing right put underwear on your
129:36 head or something yeah yeah yeah the one
129:38 I remember that just came to mind is
129:39 they told me I was like okay dare and
129:41 then they said to go outside
129:44 act like a cow get on all fours and take
129:46 a big mouthful of the grass and chew it
129:48 so that was kind of that's a creative
129:50 dare yeah yeah that was like that's why
129:51 I still remember it cuz usually they're
129:53 just kind of like I dare you to like I
129:54 don't know drink too much ketchup versa
129:56 I don't know just something kind of hey
129:58 you know how's peekaboo drinking too
129:59 much ketchup not too much ketchup is no
130:04 that's too much kitchen I decided to
130:07 tablespoons was adequate it's like the
130:13 every time all right I'm out I think
130:17 maybe you're out okay great so those are
130:20 a few things that perhaps I think most
130:22 if not all American kids know or are
130:24 aware of a lot of them were games maybe
130:27 you have similar games in your country
130:29 so if you if you've had some interesting
130:32 experiences playing these games or if
130:33 you have a game that's similar to one of
130:36 the games or one of the ideas that we've
130:39 talked about here please let us know in
130:40 a comment and be interesting to compare
130:42 any other ideas about it that's about it
130:45 okay
130:46 well thanks very much for joining us for
130:48 this episode of English topic we will
130:50 see you again soon take care bye hi
130:53 everybody welcome back to top words my
130:55 name is Alisha and today we're gonna
130:57 talk about ten different ways to
130:58 remember words so these are actually
131:01 some ways to remember words that you
131:03 have sent in to us so I'm really excited
131:05 to see what your recommendations are I
131:07 study other languages so let's talk
131:10 about it let's see I associate new words
131:12 with words that sound similar in my
131:14 native language if you're studying
131:16 English your native language might share
131:19 some words so like I'm studying Japanese
131:21 and for example the word chocolate
131:24 sounds very very similar in in Japanese
131:27 so in English the word is chocolate in
131:29 Japanese the word is chocolate evil so
131:32 it sounds similar so that's an easy word
131:34 for me to remember I learn about the
131:36 roots of words and how different words
131:38 are related to each other many words in
131:41 English have roots in
131:43 very very old languages like Latin so a
131:46 word like omniscient for example can be
131:49 broken down into maybe two parts the
131:51 Omni Omni meaning all or everything and
131:54 she int the science part relates to
131:57 knowledge or knowing so together the
131:59 word means all-knowing omniscient maybe
132:02 you can guess the meaning even if it's
132:04 the first time you've seen the word okay
132:06 I listen to songs and memorize the
132:08 lyrics this is also a common way to to
132:11 help kids learn things too through songs
132:14 opposite of B plus or minus a square
132:17 root B squared minus 4ac all over 2a
132:20 it's a quadratic function equation
132:22 because it's a song it's still in my
132:24 head Thank You mrs. Sam I often watch TV
132:28 or YouTube videos that are designed for
132:30 young children that's how children in
132:32 the native language learn so it's a
132:34 great tool for you don't be embarrassed
132:36 to do that I do that in English we have
132:38 Dora the Explorer
132:39 we have Sesame Street we have another
132:42 channel that's made for children's
132:44 content but it could be useful for you
132:47 it's called kids vs. life so please be
132:49 sure to check that out I speak as often
132:51 as possible with native speakers a
132:53 native speaker can go on that's that's a
132:55 strange thing that you're saying so
132:56 there are a lot of small factors that
132:58 you can't get unless you're speaking
133:00 with a native speaker so this is a
133:02 really really great tip if you're
133:04 interested in doing this with us we have
133:06 on English class 101.com
133:08 a special subscription which is called
133:11 the elite level of subscription where
133:13 you get to actually study with one of
133:15 our teachers here so if if you don't
133:18 have somebody that you can study with
133:20 now that might be a way to do it please
133:22 check that out if you're interested I
133:24 try to use the language routinely in the
133:26 context of daily life when you're alone
133:29 just doing stuff at home like making
133:31 breakfast or cooking or doing the
133:33 laundry if you use the language just to
133:35 say like now I'm going to I don't know
133:38 cut vegetables or oh I need to do
133:40 laundry later today or thinking about
133:42 your appointment whatever another good
133:44 example is really I put my phone into my
133:47 target language you're telling little
133:48 stories when you're having conversations
133:50 with people so get used to telling
133:52 yourself the story I use repetition
133:54 reading writing and speaking words
133:57 over and over again keep repeating in
133:59 your studies even if it feels like you
134:02 know you're not making any progress you
134:04 are just just the act of doing that
134:06 repetition can be helpful for you if a
134:08 football player never throws a football
134:10 he's not going to be able to throw it
134:13 very well is he you have to repeat
134:15 repeat repeat and then when you're faced
134:17 with the actual situation where you need
134:19 to throw the football you need to use
134:21 that vocabulary word you're ready you
134:23 already know how to say the word so yes
134:25 repeat it's good I try to think in
134:28 English so it becomes natural to my
134:29 thought process I do this I think about
134:32 what I need to do I think about what I
134:34 have done I think about what I'm going
134:36 to do and so in that way you can
134:38 practice past tense future tense and
134:40 present tense recently this has been
134:42 happening to me I've started dreaming in
134:44 Japanese from time to time or I dream
134:46 bilingually it's exciting I think I try
134:48 to use the word in a simple sentence so
134:50 I learn whole phrases not just
134:52 individual words yes this is a huge tip
134:55 so vocabulary is important of course if
134:58 you don't know a key word you might miss
135:00 the meaning of something but context is
135:03 important too so there might be two
135:05 words which seem very similar like big
135:07 and large for example but when should I
135:09 use large when should I use big like if
135:12 your clothes shopping and you say mm do
135:14 you have this in a big size it might not
135:16 be the correct way to use the word
135:18 instead do you have this in a large size
135:20 is the correct phrase so learning how to
135:23 use the correct vocabulary word at the
135:25 correct time is important and you can do
135:28 that through studying sentences and
135:30 phrases instead of just vocabulary this
135:33 is why reading is important I feel
135:34 reading as much as possible especially
135:36 the newspaper helps me to remember words
135:39 when I was a kid I just read everything
135:41 I was I was so into reading I loved it
135:44 and I think that it helped it actually
135:46 helped my language skills improve even
135:48 in my native language again at first
135:50 it's really hard to do and you might
135:52 have to use a dictionary a lot but
135:54 you'll learn gradually more natural
135:56 speaking patterns more natural writing
135:58 patterns too which will help you to
136:00 sound more natural when you speak and
136:02 maybe it can help your listening skills
136:04 too when you can listen for those
136:06 patterns that you see in textbooks that
136:08 you see in newspapers and novels
136:09 whatever
136:10 is a great tool reading and thank
136:13 goodness that's the end so those are 10
136:15 tips that you can use to remember new
136:18 words and new phrases try them out I'm
136:20 going to be doing my best with my target
136:21 language I hope that you do too thank

144:04 what time's breakfast
144:10 now the lesson focus here's how to check
144:12 in at a hotel ready
144:17 do you remember the first thing gu
144:19 stavos said to the hotel clerk in the
144:21 scene after he introduces himself
144:25 I have a reservation
144:28 first is the phrase I have next is the
144:33 phrase
144:35 reservation together it's I have a
144:39 reservation use this expression to
144:42 indicate that you've reserved a room in
144:45 advance you can also use this phrase in
144:48 other situations where you made a
144:49 reservation such as at a restaurant now
144:52 you try
144:53 imagine you have just come to a
144:56 restaurant where you've made a
144:57 reservation what would you say
145:05 I have a reservation now imagine you've
145:09 booked a rental car online and you're
145:11 checking in to pick up your car what
145:14 would you say

145:27 hotel has a shop is there a shop in this
145:30 hotel first is the phrase is there and
145:35 next is the phrase a shop last is the
145:40 phrase
145:42 in this hotel together its is there a
145:46 shop in this hotel this structure allows
145:50 you to easily ask if something is nearby
145:53 or in a particular location start your
145:56 question with is there and then insert
146:00 something you are looking for finally
146:03 add a location now you try
146:06 imagine you're checking into a hotel and
146:09 want to know if there's an ATM in the
146:12 hotel what would you say
146:20 is there an ATM in this hotel now
146:24 imagine you're in a shopping mall and
146:26 want to find out if there's a coffee
146:28 shop in the mall what would you say

146:39 small
146:40 do you remember how gustavo asks if
146:43 there is shampoo or conditioner in the
146:46 room
146:47 is there any shampoo or conditioner in
146:50 the room
146:51 first is the phrase is there any next is
146:57 the phrase shampoo or conditioner and
147:01 last is the phrase in the room together
147:06 it's is there any shampoo or conditioner
147:11 in the room this phrase structure is
147:14 very similar to the one we just learned
147:16 except the word NE is used to refer to
147:21 uncountable nouns such as shampoo water
147:25 or bread the structure is is there any
147:30 followed by the item and location now
147:34 you try imagine you're checking into a
147:37 hotel and you want to know if there is
147:39 bottled water in the room what would you
147:42 say

153:36 in the scene what did Gustavo say when
153:40 he gave his passport to the immigration
153:42 officer
153:44 here you are
153:46 this short sentence helps indicate that
153:49 someone is giving something to someone
153:51 in response to a request first is the
153:55 word here next is the word you and last
154:01 is the word are together it's here you
154:07 are
154:08 try saying this as Gustavo hands his
154:11 passport over to the immigration officer
154:15 passport please hello
154:23 here you are
154:25 at the end of the scene how does the
154:28 immigration officer welcome Gustavo
154:31 welcome to the United States
154:34 this is a polite and sometimes friendly
154:38 way to indicate to someone that you're
154:40 glad to have them to a home place of
154:43 work or another place somehow belonging
154:45 to you it starts with the core phrase
154:49 welcome to and then finishes with the
154:53 location in this case the United States
154:59 try saying this after the immigration
155:02 officer speaks
155:04 okay thank you
155:12 welcome to the United States
155:17 now the lesson focus here's what you say
155:20 to navigate passport control ready
155:25 do you remember the first question the
155:27 immigration officer asked after Gustavo
155:30 gave him his passport
155:32 how long will you be staying immigration
155:36 officers asked this question to find out
155:39 about the length of a visitor's stay
155:41 they want to know if a visitor plans to
155:44 stay for two weeks for example or one
155:47 month first is the phrase how long next
155:53 is the word will after this is the word
155:58 you and last is the phrase be staying
156:05 Gustavo responds with a length of time
156:08 for six weeks
156:11 first is the word for next is the number
156:17 six and last is the word weeks together
156:24 it's
156:26 for six weeks the sentence structure to
156:29 answer the question how long will you be
156:32 staying is four plus number of days or
156:37 weeks imagine you're going to stay for
156:40 two weeks answer the question how long
156:43 will you be staying
156:51 for two weeks do you remember the second
156:55 question the immigration officer asked
156:58 Gustavo in the scene
157:00 and where will you be staying
157:03 this question is identical to the first
157:05 question except instead of saying how
157:09 long the immigration officer asked where
157:15 the immigration officer is asking to
157:18 find out which hotel or address a
157:21 visitor will be staying at again it's
157:24 where will you be staying in response
157:29 Gustavo gives the name of his hotel at
157:33 the Four Seasons Hotel
157:36 first is the word at and after this is
157:40 the name of the hotel the Four Seasons
157:44 Hotel together it's at the Four Seasons
157:49 Hotel the sentence structure to answer
157:53 the question where will you be staying
157:55 is at plus your hotel name imagine
158:02 you'll be staying at the Plaza Hotel
158:04 answer the question where will you be
158:08 staying
158:15 at The Plaza Hotel do you remember the
158:18 third question the immigration officer
158:21 asked in the scene what's the purpose of
158:24 your visit
158:26 the immigration officer asks this to
158:29 understand why Gustavo is visiting first
158:32 is a contraction of what and is what's
158:38 next is the word the
158:42 after this is the word purpose next is
158:47 the word of following this is the word
158:52 your and last is the word visit together
158:59 it's what's the purpose of your visit
159:02 in response gustavo answers I'm here on
159:08 business
159:09 this starts with the core phrase I'm
159:13 here on following this core phrase is
159:17 the word business altogether it's I'm
159:23 here on business
159:25 this means that Gustavo is in the
159:28 country to do business and not just to
159:31 sightsee alternatively he could have
159:34 said I'm here for pleasure this is the
159:38 same pattern as the first response the
159:42 only difference is that on business has
159:46 been taken out and for pleasure is used
159:51 instead again
159:53 that's I'm here for pleasure now you try
159:59 imagine your trip is for sightseeing
160:01 answer the question what's the purpose
160:05 of your visit
160:12 I'm here for pleasure now imagine you
160:16 are visiting the US on business answer
160:19 the question what's the purpose of your
160:22 visit
160:28 I'm here on business
160:33 now it's time to practice your new

161:58 that practice with us in the comments
162:00 until you're ready to go bye next
162:07 passport please
162:09 hello here you are how long will you be
162:13 staying for six weeks and where will you
162:16 be staying at the Four Seasons Hotel
162:20 what's the purpose of your visit I'm
162:22 here on business okay thank you
162:26 welcome to the United States hi
162:30 everybody my name is Alisha and today
162:31 I'm joined by Michael hello and today
162:35 we're going to be talking about the
162:37 college experience in the United States
162:39 so we're gonna be sharing some things
162:41 that we think are maybe very common if
162:44 you attend the college in the United
162:46 States so let's begin why don't we start
162:49 with you Michael what is your first item
162:51 first item is four years
162:58 for years this is something I mean it's
163:02 not too exciting to talk about but one
163:04 of my friends from the UK was asking me
163:06 about you know how long does it take
163:08 what's the typical amount of time
163:09 because I guess in the UK and I'm sure
163:12 this is different from wherever you are
163:13 in the world you know they do three
163:15 years three years something like that
163:16 for us typically you do your secondary
163:20 education as high school and that's four
163:23 years so grade 9 10 11 12 you graduate
163:26 around 18 years old 17 18 and then you
163:30 go to university and the degrees are the
163:33 most common is 4 years which is your
163:35 bachelor's right and some people do 2
163:38 years for an associate's and then you
163:39 can go on and get masters in it you know
163:41 that kind of varies how long you want to
163:43 take personally how many majors blah
163:44 blah blah but I guess in the UK it's
163:46 typically three years for University
163:49 yeah for for the average University time
163:52 because they yeah they're their
163:54 education their high school is different
163:55 too so oh I shouldn't know that yeah me
163:57 either
163:57 until just last week okay the first year
164:00 each each year in college has a name and
164:04 as well as in high school too so the
164:06 first year is called or the students the
164:10 students that are the first year
164:11 students are called the freshmen
164:12 freshmen if you think about that word
164:14 fresh man so fresh meaning new and man
164:17 in this case I'm just meeting people but
164:18 man so the first year there is this
164:22 thing called the Freshman Fifteen which
164:24 maybe you've heard of the freshman 15 I
164:27 don't know if you know this one freshman
164:29 15 the 15 in freshman 15 refers to 15
164:32 pounds or pounds in terms of body weight
164:37 so kind of a joke that's that you might
164:40 hear if you go to a college in the US or
164:42 maybe in another country too you have
164:44 this is freshmen move out of their
164:47 parents home and go to school where they
164:51 start eating cafeteria food anytime they
164:53 like they can get their own snacks
164:55 they're on their own essentially and the
164:57 joke is that freshmen gain 15 pounds in
165:01 their freshman year of college
165:03 do you know about the freshman 15 yeah I
165:05 know it all too well I I gained that you
165:08 got the freshman 20 year some
165:11 so my problem is I mean partly I think
165:14 the typical thing is because of the
165:16 freedom your parents have a set meal you
165:18 have you know like extracurricular
165:19 activities I I actually lost weight my
165:22 first term of college but then after
165:24 that I changed things up a bit and then
165:26 it was like oh just like a monster I was
165:31 looking at pictures like it's just like
165:32 last week or something like that
165:33 whoa was such a difference actually yeah
165:36 I had a bit of wealth just watching all
165:39 the English in three minutes video
165:40 you'll get like he'll get the idea yeah
165:42 okay yeah so freshman 15 that's a common
165:45 one all right
165:46 what's your next one so I mean this kind
165:48 of relates to the freshman 15 is is to
165:54 party partying party all the time
165:57 party on Wayne carne on Garth so I mean
166:00 you're free so maybe in high school a
166:02 lot of people drink and go party but you
166:05 have to keep it secret from your parents
166:07 you have to you know do the thing where
166:09 you you call and you say I'm gonna stay
166:12 at Alicia's house and Alicia's parents
166:15 think she's staying at my house and we
166:16 both go to a party where the parents are
166:18 out of town we you have to be very
166:20 secret but in college anytime there's
166:22 always somebody who wants to party and
166:24 there's always the bad influence you
166:26 just doesn't care they want to drop out
166:27 so there's always a party if you seek it
166:29 it's there
166:30 so with that you know that's where you
166:32 can gain the freshman 15 is drinking a
166:35 lot of calories
166:35 this leads actually perfectly into
166:39 slight variation I wrote themed parties
166:42 for one of my cards because this beyond
166:46 especially beyond the freshman year so
166:48 the second year of college is called
166:50 sophomoric the students are called
166:52 sophomores third year they're called
166:54 juniors and fourth-year seniors so in
166:57 your sophomore junior and senior year of
166:59 college typically I would say you move
167:01 out of the dorm and into a house or an
167:03 apartment and it is there in the freedom
167:06 beyond the college campus that you can
167:09 have themed parties so I'm betting that
167:14 you have some stories we had some themed
167:16 parties my friends and I what kind of we
167:18 did of course Halloween parties we did
167:20 those we had a blacklight party one time
167:23 where we placed all the all the lights
167:25 in the house with black lights and
167:26 everyone wore a white t-shirt and
167:28 brought a highlighter and then if we
167:29 would draw a things or write things on
167:31 people's t-shirts that was fun yeah I
167:33 like that that was actually really fun
167:36 we did a camo camp everybody had to wear
167:40 camo at the party that was I think we
167:44 did there's a very very key thing that
167:48 appears in beer pong which is this the
167:50 Red Solo Cup so Solo is the brand of Cup
167:53 that is just it's if you've watched a
167:56 movie that's set in an American or and
168:00 if you've watched a movie that's set in
168:04 college in the US you will have seen the
168:07 characters at the party holding this red
168:09 plastic cup and it's the brand is so low
168:12 and I don't know how it came to be that
168:16 this was just the college cup but it is
168:18 it's just at every party it's just cheap
168:20 and I didn't know this until recently
168:22 but there are lines on that red so look
168:24 like maybe I'm graphic here I don't know
168:27 but there are lines on that Red Solo Cup
168:29 where the bottom line on the cup is the
168:33 amount of a shot like a shot a spirit
168:37 straw the next line up is one serving of
168:40 wine after that is a beer I think so I
168:44 like the lines actually have a meaning
168:46 to them apparently I don't know if it's
168:48 true
168:48 I read that recently though because I
168:50 was looking for them yeah my life could
168:53 not find them I couldn't find them but
168:56 yes that that Cup is the College Cup via
169:00 the college cup of the college
169:03 experience
169:04 okay experimenting is my next one
169:08 because actually my favorite place to go
169:12 as far as clubs are gay clubs I love gay
169:14 clubs and the first time I went to a gay
169:16 club was in university and the whole
169:18 atmosphere is just very accepting so I
169:21 think probably because in the LGBT
169:24 community there's discrimination and so
169:27 there as demographic generally very
169:30 accepting very laid-back so I can go
169:32 there and just have fun you can wear
169:33 whatever you want you can talk and dance
169:34 to whoever just a lot of fun
169:36 and I think in university like this is
169:39 actually a phrase that my friends would
169:40 always say and I I don't know if this is
169:41 an idiom or something or maybe just my
169:43 friends but it's College is about
169:45 experiences and you always hear that and
169:47 like when someone's you know not sure
169:48 they don't want to do something hey come
169:50 on college is about experiences let's go
169:52 hike that mountain and experiment in
169:54 many different ways did you have
169:56 anything like this I was honestly trying
169:58 to think of something some big change
170:02 like I I did I did start drinking in
170:05 college yes but I really didn't do
170:08 anything that was honestly I really I've
170:10 never been like a super crazy crazy
170:12 person I'll try new things like oh I'll
170:14 try like new food or like oh I don't
170:16 know I like going to interesting events
170:18 or like festivals or that kind of thing
170:21 is fine but as far as like you know
170:22 making a drastic change to my appearance
170:24 or anything like that I really didn't
170:27 know sororities and fraternities
170:29 sororities and fraternities a sorority
170:32 is a group of girls who live together in
170:35 one house and do things I was not a
170:38 member of a sorority so I don't really
170:40 know details somebody I'm sure out there
170:42 probably knows more than me
170:44 fraternities on the other hand are
170:46 groups of men who live together call
170:48 their so they're college age women and
170:50 college age men who live together and
170:51 they do things together the image of a
170:56 sorority or fraternity is that they're
170:58 kind of at least my image is that
171:01 they're wealthy kind of privileged kids
171:07 which is not even necessarily true but
171:10 this is I feel like this is the image
171:11 that appears in a lot of movies about
171:13 college experiences in America or in the
171:17 States all right very nice very nice
171:20 it's interesting to compare our
171:21 different experiences any final thoughts
171:23 on college in the u.s. that's it yeah if
171:26 you have a chance give it a try or just
171:28 you know studying in any country outside
171:30 your own it's an interesting experience
171:31 so as Michael said before you know
171:34 experimenting can be an interesting way
171:35 to broaden your horizons whatever that
171:38 means for you okay so that's all for us
171:41 for today about the college experience
171:43 in the USA thanks very much for watching
171:45 and we will see
171:46 again soon bye hi everybody welcome back
171:50 to english topics my name is Alisha and
171:52 I'm here today again with Michael hello
171:55 and today we're going to be talking
171:57 about questions that we have been asked
171:59 so let's begin what is the first
172:02 question that you would like to discuss
172:04 today Michael I would like to discuss
172:10 what's the main difference between
172:12 British and American English so for me
172:19 I'd like to get this out of the way
172:22 Canadians and Americans sound pretty
172:24 much the same it's hard for us to tell
172:26 the difference even even native English
172:29 speakers there's a couple telltale signs
172:31 you know say some things but it's
172:33 usually usually regional so I guess
172:34 North Americans and then like UK English
172:37 and again there's a lot of different
172:40 accents and dialects you know it all
172:43 depends but for me the easiest way is
172:46 Americans enunciate every word we're
172:49 very loud and we open our mouths a lot
172:52 hello how are you where are you from
172:55 teacher water we enunciate every sound
172:59 so um for me a dead giveaway is that at
173:01 our end our right it's tough I listen
173:05 for vowel sounds and try to guess based
173:08 on that so your question is about
173:09 British English and American English
173:12 there's also Australian English there's
173:14 Scottish English there's Irish English
173:16 there's so many different English
173:18 speaking and dialects and honestly
173:19 sometimes it's hard for us to understand
173:21 we're both from relatively the same part
173:24 of America so we have the same speaking
173:26 style our accents are the same but to go
173:29 through all of the different dialects
173:31 and others to try and approximate the to
173:33 try them to try and say them badly too
173:35 would probably just be a waste of time
173:36 but you're on the Internet look it up
173:41 okay I guess we'll go to the next one um
173:44 let's see my questions let's see I'm
173:48 gonna start with a grammar question that
173:50 I get a lot a grammar question that I
173:52 come across as students ask me this
173:55 question the present tense versus the
173:57 progressive
173:58 hence what is the difference when should
174:00 I use present tense versus progressive
174:02 tense so by this I mean of verbs the
174:04 present tense is used for facts things
174:08 which are always true things which are
174:10 part of your regular schedule the
174:12 progressive tense has a few different
174:13 meanings to it a few different uses to
174:15 it but one of the meanings are one of
174:17 the uses is to express something which
174:19 is temporary which is not part of your
174:22 regular schedule or another uses to
174:24 describe a trend so you use a very
174:27 common mistake as an example if I ask
174:30 the question where do you work a lot of
174:34 times the response I get from my
174:36 students is I am working in America
174:40 depending on on the situation that
174:44 sentence could be correct but if you're
174:46 talking about the place where you work
174:48 always every day you go to that job it
174:50 could be the location of your office it
174:53 could be the country or the city where
174:54 you work if it's a part of your regular
174:56 schedule you want to explain a fact that
174:59 is true about your life you should use
175:01 the present tense not the progressive
175:03 tense so the correct version of that
175:06 sentence should be I work in America
175:08 that's part of my regular schedule if
175:10 however you're only in America for the
175:13 week for example you can use the
175:16 progressive tense but it's more natural
175:17 to say for example this week I'm working
175:20 in America that's a much much more
175:22 natural sentence to use how do I
175:25 pronounce the th sound so you know
175:30 depending
175:30 who I'm teaching English to they'll have
175:34 problems with different pronunciation
175:36 sounds but for me I think one that's
175:38 that's common with a lot of different
175:40 cultures is the th sound and I think
175:44 again this goes back to like the
175:45 different ways of speaking and how
175:47 Americans we and then see it every word
175:50 and we push our the way we speak to the
175:52 very tip of our mouth
175:53 that's the th sound so most people are
175:55 capable of making the th sound but
175:58 they're just a little shy and it just
176:00 doesn't seem natural it's almost as if
176:02 you can bite the tip of your tongue off
176:04 when you say the sound right and then
176:09 just another thing to note is that th
176:11 can have a hard or a soft or voiced or
176:14 unvoiced sound so the is hard or voiced
176:19 you hum mmm the the and then with like
176:23 think it's a soft or unvoiced you don't
176:26 hum you don't vibrate you just say think
176:29 but it's still the tongue goes touches
176:32 your teeth think that this is another
176:37 grammar point that I get questions about
176:39 from time to time it is the present
176:41 perfect tense versus the simple past
176:43 tense the question is when do I use them
176:46 so present perfect tense let's see an
176:49 example of present perfect tense would
176:51 be I have been to Paris simple past
176:54 tense would be I went to Paris what is
176:57 the difference we use the present
176:58 perfect tense to talk about a life
177:00 experience or something which occurred
177:02 in the past but which still affects the
177:05 present so in this case in my Paris
177:07 example sentence it's something that
177:09 happened in the past but when exactly
177:12 when is not important we just want to
177:14 say I have had the life experience of
177:17 going to Paris simple past however is
177:20 used to refer to a specific point in
177:22 time in the past so for example I went
177:25 to Paris last summer it's important that
177:27 you know I went last summer if the time
177:30 point when you went to Paris is not
177:32 important use the present perfect tense
177:35 so this is really useful for talking
177:37 about your travel experiences for
177:39 talking about your study experiences
177:41 foods you have and have-not
177:43 Eitan so keep just try to keep in mind
177:47 when when you should use these two
177:49 they're very commonly used together like
177:51 for example you might use the present
177:53 perfect tense to introduce a question
177:55 have you ever been to Paris and the
177:57 follow-up answer oh yes I have been to
178:00 Paris using the present perfect tense
178:02 again but then a common pattern is to
178:05 follow that answer up with a simple past
178:08 question when did you go so you can see
178:10 it changes from present perfect tense to
178:13 simple past tense so a larger life
178:15 experience to a more simple life
178:16 experience so they're used together but
178:19 just be careful try to be aware of am i
178:22 talking about an overall life experience
178:25 or a very specific life experience this
178:28 is one that many of my students struggle
178:30 this is more cultural why do Americans
178:33 wear shoes inside the house on the bed
178:37 etc I feel like this depends and this is
178:42 starting to change I take my shoes off
178:44 in most houses but I guess it's more so
178:46 for comfort whereas I feel like on the
178:48 east side of the world it's more of like
178:51 a cleanliness kind of a thing and if you
178:54 do still wear your shoes it's pretty
178:55 taboo whereas in the states I feel like
178:57 most people from my experience anecdotal
179:00 evidence just personal experience most
179:04 places you take off your shoes but if
179:07 they have a party they let people wear
179:09 shoes inside the house they don't care
179:10 and a lot of my friends will see
179:13 American movies and they see somebody a
179:14 main character wearing their shoes on
179:16 the bed on the couch something like that
179:20 again from my experience it's not that
179:23 big of a deal but typically you wouldn't
179:24 do that for me the the the rule of thumb
179:27 like they're the unsaid rule is that you
179:30 can put your shoes up but you don't let
179:33 your shoes touch the couch you kind of
179:36 you hang off right so you can if you
179:38 want to lay on the couch without taking
179:40 your shoes off you let your feet hang
179:42 off cuz yeah of course they're gonna get
179:44 dirty but yeah it's just not as
179:45 emphasized as much in our culture I
179:47 don't know the last question I have is
179:49 can I ask a question the answer is yes
179:51 the answer is yes and in probably 95% of
179:56 cases the answer to
179:57 the question can I ask a question is yes
179:59 okay why did I choose this question my
180:03 students sometimes will put their hands
180:06 up in my lesson and say can I ask a
180:08 question like one this is your English
180:10 class yes please ask question um but -
180:14 also this is a discussion I've been
180:16 having with a few people recently just
180:18 about the mindset that I think is really
180:20 important when speaking English we have
180:23 experience teaching in Asia where maybe
180:27 there's a different approach to
180:28 conversations I don't know if this is
180:29 the same cultural approach to
180:31 conversations that people from other
180:33 countries have but don't wait for
180:36 permission to speak don't wait to jump
180:39 into a conversation just go for it don't
180:43 wait for someone to say oh would you
180:46 like to speak now because that's never
180:47 going to happen
180:48 so don't be shy get your tongue out and
180:51 say things and don't worry if it sounds
180:54 rude or too polite or whatever um yeah I
180:57 couldn't agree more yeah yeah just it's
180:59 it's a shift in mindset if you when you
181:01 when you start speaking that second
181:03 language like you said if you just
181:05 change your mind just a little bit just
181:07 make a small shift in your mindset maybe
181:10 you'll see ah that's what it takes just
181:12 let go a little bit of your home
181:15 language and see what happens great so
181:18 those are some questions that we have
181:19 been asked about teaching about English
181:23 about culture if you have any other
181:26 questions by the way please make sure to
181:28 leave them in a comment for us or if
181:29 there's something that you've always
181:30 wondered about or if there's something
181:32 that you've encountered recently that
181:34 confused you whatever leave it in a
181:36 comment for us and maybe we will talk
181:37 about it in the future
