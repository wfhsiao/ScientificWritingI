00:03	people hate me people fear me you see
00:08	I'm a communication professor and these
00:12	people who fear me and hate me are some
00:15	of the brightest most creative most
00:18	entrepreneurial people I know I wield a
00:23	tool and that tool I wield is what makes
00:26	them fear and despise me as a professor
00:31	I have the ability to do what's called
00:33	cold calling that's where I look at a
00:36	student and say what do you think what
00:38	do you feel about what we just discussed
00:40	how does this impact you and this causes
00:45	panic not just for my students but for
00:50	everybody that moment where we are
00:53	called upon to speak articulately can we
00:57	do it now rest assured I never cold call
01:01	on my students I think it's rude and I
01:04	know it's hard but people fear it 85% of
01:11	people say they fear speaking in public
01:14	and quite frankly I think the other 15%
01:17	are lying I think we could find a
01:19	situation that makes them nervous too so
01:23	today my goal is to share with you some
01:26	tips and techniques that you can use to
01:28	help you be more comfortable and
01:30	confident when you're speaking in other
01:33	words to be able to think fast and talk
01:36	smart to do this we're going to look at
01:39	four different steps first we're going
01:42	to talk about the approach we take then
01:45	we'll speak about the audience we talk
01:46	to the context in which we find
01:49	ourselves
01:49	and finally the structures we use to
01:53	help our messages get across so let's
01:57	start by talking about approach you know
02:00	I was reminded about the importance of
02:02	approach many many years ago when my
02:05	wife and I first moved in with each
02:07	other
02:07	you see we fought a lot over little
02:10	things
02:12	things mostly that happened in our
02:14	bathrooms we called these our bathroom
02:16	brawls is the toilet seat up is the
02:18	toilet seat down by far the biggest
02:21	fight my wife and I ever had was over
02:24	toothpaste you see my wife's a roller
02:28	and I'm a squeezer in all of you out
02:32	there who are rollers I appreciate the
02:34	fine artwork you create out of your
02:36	toothpaste but you know that the most
02:39	awful thing that can happen to you is to
02:42	have a squeezer come by and ruin all
02:44	that effort you've put in but to me
02:46	getting toothpaste out of a toothpaste
02:48	tube is an act of aggression I feel
02:49	powerful in the morning in the evening
02:51	and we would fight incessantly over
02:55	little things like this and finally my
02:56	wife who is much smarter than I said
02:59	timeout what are we doing here
03:01	we've just been married we love each
03:03	other and yet we're fighting all the
03:04	time we need to look at this differently
03:06	and as soon as we started looking at our
03:09	bathroom brawls as opportunities
03:14	opportunities to learn about each other
03:16	to make concessions to collaborate
03:19	things changed and I'm happy to say
03:22	after 15 years of marriage we no longer
03:25	fight over toothpaste this same approach
03:29	is true in communication most of us when
03:33	we are in situations where we need to
03:34	communicate we see them as threatening
03:38	we see them as opportunities for failure
03:41	and I'd like to suggest that we need to
03:44	change that we need to approach
03:46	communication in an open way see it as
03:49	an opportunity to share our ideas our
03:51	beliefs our innovations and when we take
03:54	a perspective of openness all of a
03:57	sudden something that we dread becomes
04:00	something that we embrace so the first
04:02	step to effective communication is to
04:04	approach it in an open way but that's
04:09	not enough we need to think about the
04:12	audience that we're speaking to and to
04:16	me the way to approach it is the
04:17	opposite the way most people do most of
04:21	us think about here's what I want to say
04:24	or here's what
04:25	I need to say I would suggest that's
04:27	exactly wrong you need to think about
04:29	what does my audience need to hear and
04:34	that sounds just like verbal jujitsu
04:36	where I'm moving words around but in
04:38	fact it's a fundamental difference if I
04:41	ask myself what does my audience need it
04:43	puts me in service of my audience it's
04:46	about their needs and in order to
04:48	understand those needs I have to do some
04:50	reconnaissance I have to ask myself who
04:53	they are the three things I think we
04:57	need to ask are about our audience are
04:59	what is their knowledge what is it that
05:02	they know and if they don't know enough
05:05	what can we do to scaffold that
05:07	information so that they have the tools
05:10	they need in addition to knowledge we
05:12	need to be thinking about their
05:14	expectations and by expectations I mean
05:17	what is it that they expect of me most
05:22	audiences have heard the types of
05:24	presentations you're giving maybe it's a
05:27	pitch maybe it's some kind of
05:29	advertisement or marketing maybe it's a
05:32	TED talk your audience has heard those
05:35	kind of presentations before so what do
05:37	they expect of you and then you can
05:40	choose to conform to those expectations
05:41	or not you know I have two young kids
05:44	and I learned that sometimes violating
05:47	their expectations actually isn't the
05:49	most effective thing I can do for the
05:51	communication we need my boys sometimes
05:54	make me upset and when they make me
05:57	upset I used to raise my voice to no
05:59	avail nothing happened I was ignored and
06:03	that's tough for a communication guy so
06:06	what I started to do when I'm really
06:08	upset with my boys I lower my voice and
06:12	they stop dead in their tracks violating
06:16	expectations sometimes can actually help
06:18	you as a communicator the final thing we
06:21	need to think about or what are their
06:23	attitudes the way you approach your
06:26	communication is influenced by what your
06:28	audience thinks about what you're
06:30	talking on are they in favor of it are
06:33	they against it or they hesitant
06:34	agnostic those are the things you need
06:36	to be asking yourself
06:38	when you communicate so we need to
06:41	appreciate our audience when my older
06:45	child was in kindergarten I volunteered
06:48	I came into his classroom the teacher
06:51	had to leave to take a call or something
06:52	and I was in charge of an art project Oh
06:56	was that a mistake the kids were running
06:59	around I was saying oh stop this Johnny
07:01	Sally stop doing that nobody listened
07:04	the yoda-like teacher returned saw the
07:08	chaos that had ensued in her brief
07:10	absence and simply looked at the
07:12	children and started rewarding the
07:14	positive behavior Janet she said what a
07:19	lovely way you've cleaned up your
07:20	crayons
07:22	Samuel thank you so much for walking
07:25	with the scissors the students stopped
07:30	in their tracks changed their behavior I
07:32	learned then that you need to understand
07:35	your audience and what they need into
07:38	this day I try to apply those principles
07:39	I also learned that I could never teach
07:43	elementary school students if guilt and
07:45	shame doesn't work I can't teach them so
07:49	knowing your audience really matters but
07:52	beyond knowing your audience you have to
07:54	appreciate the context in which you
07:56	speak whenever you speak you are in a
07:59	particular context and to me context
08:02	comes in a bunch of different varieties
08:03	the first thing about context we need to
08:06	think about is the time what time of day
08:08	are you communicating if you're talking
08:12	early in the morning you might have to
08:14	have a little more energy to keep people
08:15	moving same thing after lunch when
08:17	people are having that food coma
08:19	experience I taught high school many
08:23	many years ago and I don't think my
08:25	principal liked me very much because she
08:27	gave me freshmen right before lunch
08:30	and right after lunch and if you know
08:33	anything about 14 15 year old kids they
08:35	need lots of food and lots of social
08:38	experience so by the time my first class
08:41	of freshmen came to me after 4 hours of
08:43	class they were dead tired they could
08:46	barely move let alone think right after
08:49	lunch when my second batch joined me
08:51	they were amped up
08:53	on their food their caffeine their
08:55	friends it was a frenzy in my classroom
08:58	and I had to teach them the same thing
09:01	how did I do it I changed the way we
09:05	approach the class the class before
09:08	lunch was highly collaborative people
09:09	were moving around lots of activities
09:11	after lunch a little more mellow you
09:14	must address the context the timing so
09:17	your message can be effective context
09:21	also involves emotion most of us when we
09:25	communicate we think about information
09:27	what's in my head in my heart I need to
09:29	communicate to you but we also
09:31	communicate a feeling maybe we're trying
09:34	to get people excited and motivate them
09:36	maybe we're trying to scare them create
09:39	that burning platform that motivates
09:40	them to change sometimes we're just
09:43	trying to instill confidence you should
09:44	believe in what I'm saying but we need
09:47	to think about the emotion as well as
09:49	the information the final bit of context
09:55	has to do with where you're physically
09:57	speaking location matters just the other
10:02	day I read in the newspaper that the
10:05	Girl Scout in the state of state of
10:06	California this year who sold the most
10:09	cookies during the Girl Scouts annual
10:11	cookie drive set up shop in front of a
10:15	medical marijuana dispensary she sold
10:19	more cookies than anybody location
10:22	matters think about the way the room is
10:25	set up think about the environment is it
10:27	live is it virtual those change the way
10:30	that you communicate we need to think
10:32	about location so our approach is
10:37	important our audience is important the
10:40	context in which we find ourselves is
10:43	important and so too is the way we
10:46	structure our messages it is much easier
10:51	for humans to understand information
10:53	when it is structured in fact we
10:56	remember information up to 40% better
10:58	when it's structured what do I mean by
11:02	this some of you listening are too young
11:05	to remember but
11:06	those of us of my age when we wanted to
11:08	call somebody on the phone we actually
11:11	had to remember a phone number my kids
11:14	today they look at a picture push a
11:15	button and the other person starts
11:16	talking on the phone we had it much
11:19	harder we had to remember 10 digits 10
11:22	digits are hard to remember so what did
11:24	we do we put him in a structure 3 3 & 4
11:28	that's how we remembered that's what I
11:31	mean by a structure the information is
11:33	put in a way that it makes it easy not
11:35	only for you as a speaker but also for
11:37	the audience to remember now I have lots
11:42	of favorite structures you see some of
11:44	the structures up here behind me the
11:46	first structure is a chronological
11:48	structure past present future here's how
11:52	things used to be here's how they are
11:53	today here's where they're going in the
11:55	future a chronological structure can
11:58	really help you navigate your audience
12:01	from one place to the next quite frankly
12:04	structure sets expectations you can't be
12:07	lost if you have a map your structure
12:11	provides a map and the chronological
12:13	structure is incredibly helpful for that
12:16	the next structure happens to be the
12:19	problem solution benefit structure this
12:22	is one of the most persuasive structures
12:24	out there you start by explaining what
12:26	the issue is you talk about how to solve
12:28	it and then the benefits to the people
12:32	finally my favorite structure the one
12:36	that I use the most I call this the
12:38	MacGyver of all structures this can get
12:41	you through any situation is the what so
12:45	what now what structure you start by
12:48	telling people what the issue is
12:50	you tell them why it's important in that
12:52	so what step and then you tell them
12:54	what's next what's coming it's like a
12:56	Swiss Army knife you can use it in
12:58	situations if you're teaching you can
13:01	use it if you are trying to motivate
13:02	people and you can use it even if you're
13:05	introducing somebody change the what to
13:07	a who and you've got your introduction
13:12	structure helps keep your audience
13:15	together and in line when I was an
13:18	undergraduate I
13:19	a tour guide it was the highest paying
13:21	job on campus and boy did I need money I
13:24	trained for 12 weeks to be a tour guide
13:27	I learned lots of interesting some would
13:31	say useless facts about my university
13:33	thing they drilled into our heads
13:35	besides how to walk backwards which to
13:37	this day I still can do in a straight
13:38	line the most important thing they
13:41	taught us they said above all else to be
13:44	a great tour guide at this institution
13:46	is to never lose your audience you are a
13:51	bad tour guide if your tour group gets
13:53	lost the same is true when you're
13:56	speaking structure keeps people together
13:59	we need structure so we see here that
14:06	these tools the tools that help us get
14:10	our audience engaged and involved and
14:13	help us convey our message are the same
14:16	tools that helped my students learn to
14:20	love speaking and learn to do it well
14:24	it's about the approach you take the
14:27	audience the context and the structure
14:31	now I'm always looking for examples of
14:34	this to help people understand and the
14:36	other day I was eating breakfast and I
14:38	looked across the table at my soy milk
14:40	and I said you know what this is a great
14:43	example think about it
14:46	silk soy milk silk soy milk is targeted
14:53	to a very specific audience people who
14:56	are interested in eating healthy or
14:59	people who are lactose intolerant
15:02	the name is a combination of the word
15:05	soy and milk silk it speaks to the
15:10	audience's desire to have something rich
15:12	something expensive something yummy it's
15:18	at a time and a context in an
15:21	environment if you've noticed where you
15:22	buy silk soymilk it's next to other milk
15:25	and that's not where it was originally
15:27	it used to be in the health food aisle
15:29	now it's next to milk they marketed it
15:32	and boxed it
15:33	the way milk is the structure of the
15:36	name is very compelling let's face it
15:39	they've could have called it muy and
15:43	nobody would have bought it right so if
15:47	you get the message right and you
15:49	communicate it effectively you can make
15:52	a big difference so I want for you what
15:57	I wish for all of my students bold
16:00	communication that's confident and
16:03	compelling and I want for your message
16:06	to echo long after you leave the room
16:08	and these are skills that are at your
16:10	disposal it just takes practice and a
16:14	little bit of a positive approach thank
16:17	you
