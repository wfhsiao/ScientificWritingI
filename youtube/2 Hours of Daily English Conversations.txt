58:11 here's a report on the bags that we
58:14 started selling last month first of all
58:17 when it came to color black was the
58:19 number one seller it's followed by white
58:22 and sky blue yellow didn't sell very
58:25 well so yellow was a dud well what about
58:29 the size bigger bags sold more than
58:32 smaller ones bags that could fit a
58:35 magazine or a regular letter sized
58:37 notebook in them where the most popular
58:40 okay regarding handles leather was more
58:44 popular than ones made with a metal
58:46 chain I see it looks like bags with a
58:49 more formal style sell better that's
58:52 right I think we should use more neutral
58:55 colors such as beige or brown for our
58:57 new collection okay then let's go with

74:54 let me start by explaining our clubs
74:56 different membership options as
74:58 described in this brochure regular
75:00 members can use the gym in the pool at
75:02 any time on any day of the week but we
75:04 also offer early-morning memberships
75:06 where people can use the facilities only
75:08 in the early morning and night
75:10 memberships for people who only want to
75:12 come in the evening what are the hours
75:14 for early morning members early morning
75:17 members can use the facilities from 6
75:19 a.m. to 10 a.m. and night members can
75:21 use them from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. I see so
75:25 early morning members can stop by and
75:27 use the facilities on their way to work
75:29 exactly the early morning type is
75:31 popular among people with nine-to-five
75:33 jobs and we also offer memberships just
75:36 for the gym or just for the pool if you
75:38 only want to use one of those I want to
75:41 use both the gym and the pool I think
75:43 I'll use the gym in the early morning
75:45 before going to work on weekdays and
75:46 then use the pool on the weekend if you
75:49 have a membership that covers something
75:50 like early mornings for the weekdays but
75:52 all day on the weekend we're sorry but
75:55 we don't offer a membership like that
75:56 sir okay I don't think I can get up that
75:59 early on the weekend so I'll choose this
76:01 membership option a man is joining a

76:36 from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and night members

76:41 see so early morning members can stop by

76:46 work exactly the early morning type is
76:49 popular among people with 9 to 5 jobs
76:51 and we also offer memberships just for

77:01 use the gym in the early morning before
77:02 going to work on weekdays and then use
77:04 the pool on the weekend if you have a
77:06 membership that covered
77:07 something like early mornings for the

86:26 rows of two tables per row a man and a
86:29 woman are talking about the layout of a

86:37 meeting alright shall we put all the
86:40 tables in the center of the room so that
86:41 everyone faces each other well there's
86:44 going to be a group session first so

87:05 whiteboard next to the screen well how
87:08 about putting the whiteboard at the

87:12 after the meeting we need to put
87:14 everything back where it was in four
87:16 rows of two tables per row every month
87:20 you need to check our office supplies
87:21 and order any items that are running low
87:23 this time let's take a look at them
87:26 together here's the checklist okay that
87:29 sounds good well starting with the paper
87:31 it looks like there's only one box left
87:33 we use lots of paper every day so let's
87:36 order two more boxes
87:37 okay the printer is out of color ink
87:40 should we order that we don't really
87:43 print documents in color so we don't
87:45 need to worry about that hmm okay looks
87:48 like these whiteboard markers are
87:50 running out of ink right those need to
87:52 be replaced we get a discount if we
87:55 order them in sets of five so let's do
87:57 that okay and while we're at it can we
88:00 order a mouse sometimes it works but
88:02 sometimes it doesn't that's probably
88:04 because it's running out of batteries
88:06 let's check the stock of batteries and
88:08 order more if we don't have many left
88:10 sure well we have three batteries here
88:13 you can take two of these for your mouse
88:15 but buy a six pack of batteries to
88:17 replace them a man and a woman are
88:20 talking about office supplies what will
88:23 the man order every month you need to
88:25 check our office supplies and order any
88:27 items that are running low this time
88:30 let's take a look at them together
88:31 here's the checklist Oh
88:33 okay that sounds good well starting with
88:35 the paper it looks like there's only one
88:37 box left we use lots of paper every day
88:40 so let's order two more boxes okay
88:43 the printer is out of color ink should
88:46 we order that we don't really print
88:48 documents in color so we don't need to
88:50 worry about that hmm okay
88:53 looks like these whiteboard markers are
88:55 running out of ink right those need to
88:58 be replaced we get a discount if we
89:00 order them in sets of five so let's do
89:02 that
89:02 okay and while we're at it can we order
89:05 a mouse sometimes it works but sometimes
89:07 it doesn't that's probably because it's
89:10 running out of batteries let's check the
89:12 stock of batteries in order more if we
89:14 don't have many left sure well we have
89:17 three batteries here you can take two of
89:20 these for your mouse but buy a six pack
89:22 of batteries to replace them excuse me I
89:26 need to go to the airport would you tell
89:28 me how to get there sure there are a few
89:31 ways if you take bus number one it takes
89:33 about one and a half hours to the
89:35 airport it's the least expensive way bus
89:38 number two is a non-stop bus it's more
89:41 expensive and leaves once every hour but
89:43 it only takes 50 minutes I see what
89:46 about taxis there's a taxi stand in
89:49 front of the building and they take
89:51 about an hour but they use the
89:53 expressway and charge extra for a lot of
89:55 luggage so it's going to be a lot more
89:57 expensive than the bus I guess that
89:59 makes sense and I'd like to avoid paying
90:01 too much you didn't by chance buy
90:03 anything at shopping world while you
90:05 were here they offer complimentary
90:07 shuttle service to the airport for
90:09 customers who make a purchase there wow
90:12 I didn't know that I haven't bought
90:14 anything yet but I was going to stop by
90:16 and get some souvenirs there anyway then
90:18 you can use that a woman is asking for
90:21 directions to the airport at an
90:22 information center
90:24 how is she going to get to the airport
90:26 excuse me I need to go to the airport
90:29 would you tell me how to get there
90:31 sure there are a few ways if you take
90:34 bus number one it takes about one and a
90:36 half hours to the airport it's the least
90:38 expensive way bus number two is a
90:41 non-stop bus it's more expensive and
90:44 leaves once every hour but it only takes
90:46 fifty minutes I see what about taxis
90:49 there's a taxi stand in front of the
90:51 building and they take about an hour but
90:54 they use the expressway and charge extra
90:56 for a lot of luggage so it's going to be
90:58 a lot more expensive than the bus I
91:00 guess that makes sense and I'd like to
91:03 avoid paying too much you didn't by
91:05 chance buy anything at shopping world
91:07 while you were here they offer
91:09 complimentary shuttle service to the
91:11 airport for customers who make a
91:12 purchase there Wow I didn't know that I
91:15 haven't bought anything yet but I was

95:11 them directly to this desk I see thank
95:15 you very much
95:18 what kind of trip will you be taking I'm
95:21 going scuba diving since I'll be
95:23 bringing all my own equipment I'm a bit
95:25 worried about getting it stolen very
95:28 smart of you insurance against theft is
95:30 included in all of our plans since scuba
95:33 diving equipment is an unusual type of
95:36 baggage only plan a can cover it though
95:39 alternatively you can get insurance
95:42 specifically for scuba diving equipment
95:44 and add it to other plans plan a is the
95:48 most expensive one right what's the
95:50 difference between plan B and Plan C
95:52 okay for example if you happen to stay
95:55 in a hospital abroad
95:57 Plan B covers flight tickets for your
95:59 family to visit you but Plan C doesn't I
96:03 see if I get the SPECIAL contract or
96:06 scuba diving equipment and add it to
96:07 Plan B or Plan C would it be more
96:10 expensive than plan a with Plan B that
96:13 would make it a little more expensive
96:15 but with Plan C it would be less
96:17 expensive okay by the way is there any
96:21 plan that's cheaper than Plan C yes we
96:24 have plan D but it doesn't cover
96:26 accomodation if your flight gets delayed
96:28 or cancelled so we don't recommend this
96:31 plan got it I agree that I need coverage
96:34 but I don't think I need coverage for
96:36 family plane tickets so I'll take this
96:39 plan and combine it with the insurance
96:41 for scuba diving equipment a man is
96:44 choosing an insurance plan which plan is
96:48 he going to sign up for what kind of
96:51 trip will you be taking I'm going scuba
96:54 diving since I'll be bringing all my own
96:56 equipment I'm a bit worried about
96:57 getting it stolen very smart of you
97:01 insurance against theft is included in
97:03 all of our plans since scuba diving
97:06 equipment is an unusual type of baggage
97:08 only plan a can cover it though
97:11 alternatively you can get insurance
97:14 specifically for scuba diving equipment
97:16 and add it to other plans plan a is the
97:20 most expensive one right what's the
97:22 difference between plan B and Plan C
97:25 okay for example if you happen to stay
97:27 in a hospital abroad
97:29 Plan B covers flight tickets for your
97:31 family to visit you but Plan C doesn't I
97:35 see if I get the SPECIAL contract or
97:38 scuba diving equipment and add it to
97:39 Plan B or Plan C would it be more
97:42 expensive than plan a with Plan B that
97:45 would make it a little more expensive
97:47 but with Plan C it would be less
97:50 expensive okay
97:51 by the way is there any plan that's
97:53 cheaper than Plan C yes we have plan D
97:57 but it doesn't cover accomodation if
97:59 your flight gets delayed or cancelled so
98:02 we don't recommend this plan got it I
98:05 agree that I need coverage but I don't
98:07 think I need coverage for family plane
98:09 tickets so I'll take this plan and
98:12 combine it with the insurance for scuba
98:13 diving equipment
98:17 last week we asked 200 employees to
98:21 answer a questionnaire about their
98:23 fitness habits the focus of this
98:25 questionnaire was on how many hours they
98:27 exercise each week did you tally up the
98:30 results for the a and B branches
98:32 separately yes and employees had four
98:36 options
98:36 less than an hour around one to two
98:39 hours around three to five hours and six
98:43 hours or more here are the results so
98:47 employees in both branches answered
98:49 about one to two hours the most looks
98:51 like they're exercising about once a
98:53 week yes and after that employees in the
98:57 a branch were most likely to answer
98:59 about three to five hours while in the B
99:03 branch the next most common answer was
99:06 less than an hour hmm not even ten
99:10 percent of employees at the B branch
99:11 exercised more than six hours that's
99:15 right
99:15 so I was thinking we could organize
99:17 weekly sports events there that anybody
99:19 could casually join that's a good idea
99:22 it did give employees a good chance to
99:24 socialize - I'll leave it to you thank
99:28 you I'll take care of it
99:30 a woman is reporting to her boss about
99:33 the results of a questionnaire which
99:37 graph represents the employees from the
99:39 B branch last week we asked 200
99:44 employees to answer a questionnaire
99:46 about their fitness habits the focus of
99:49 this questionnaire was on how many hours
99:51 they exercise each week did you tally up
99:54 the results for the a and B branches
99:56 separately yes and employees had four
100:00 options less than an hour
100:02 around one to two hours around three to
100:06 five hours and six hours or more here
100:09 are the results so employees in both
100:12 branches answered about one to two hours
100:14 the most looks like they're exercising
100:16 about once a week yes and after that
100:20 employees in the a branch were most
100:23 likely to answer about 3 to 5 hours
100:27 while in the B branch the next most
100:29 common answer was less than an hour hmm
100:33 not even ten percent of employees at the
100:35 B branch exercised more than six hours
100:38 that's right so I was thinking we could
100:41 organize weekly sports events there that
100:43 anybody could casually join that's a
100:46 good idea
100:46 it did give employees a good chance to
100:48 socialize too I'll leave it to you thank
100:52 you I'll take care of it
100:55 I heard we're supposed to volunteer for
100:59 some activity and write a report about
101:01 it for clefts we can choose anything
101:04 right what are you going to do I haven't
101:07 made up my mind yet what about you I
101:10 haven't decided yet either
101:12 I'm interested in environmental issues
101:13 so I'm looking for something in a nature
101:15 conservation group I see
101:18 so you want to go and pick up trash off
101:21 of the ground well that'd be okay
101:24 actually but I'm looking for a group
101:26 activity I want to learn more about a
101:28 leadership role in this kind of
101:30 organization as well if possible you
101:33 know I have a friend who helps out with
101:35 a group that plants trees with kids are
101:38 you interested in that kind of thing

101:43 be a great opportunity to interact with
101:44 children do you want to do this too
101:47 maybe but I'd like to try something a
101:50 bit more people focused you know like
101:52 helping elderly or disabled people oh my
101:56 mother is helping out at the local
101:58 Senior Center would that be interesting

103:25 no we placed it on the top shelf though
103:29 hmm maybe it's too high for some people
103:31 they probably can't see it then let's
103:34 put it on the middle shelf sounds good
103:37 they'll see it when they first come into
103:39 the store and why don't we put a red
103:41 cloth on this shelf so that they know
103:43 it's our new bread all right then we'll
103:45 have to move the croissants to somewhere
103:47 else
103:48 top or bottom why don't we put our
103:51 regular items on the top shelf they'll
103:53 sell well even if they're not easy to
103:54 spot that has to be the French bread
103:58 then let's put it in a basket

104:03 croissants have to be on the bottom okay
104:06 how does it look

104:10 week and then decide if we need to make
