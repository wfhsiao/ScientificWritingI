M: Allison, please hold all my calls for the next hour or so. 
F: Certainly, Mr. Mason. Do you need anything else? 
M: Yes, please cancel my 3pm meeting with Brad Davis. 
Also, call my wife and tell her that I'll be an hour late. 
(6) 
F: David, I understand that you've decided to leave the 
company. 
M: That's right. 
I'm going to go back to university and finish my degree. 
F: Good for you! Well, you'll certainly be missed around 
here. 
(5) 
M: Stacy, have you seen the boss this afternoon? 
F: No, I haven't seen Mr. Peterson all afternoon. 
M: I really need to speak with him. 
If you see him, can you let him know that I'm looking 
for him? 
F: Of course, Jeff. No problem. 
(4) 
F: What happened? Why did you change the channel? 
M: This show is so boring. 
I don't know how you can watch it! 
F: But I was here first! Change it back! 
M: Here, take the remote. I'm going to sleep. 
(3) 
F: What do you think of this dress? 
I just bought it yesterday. 
M: Well, to be honest, it looks a little small. 
F: That's exactly what I've been thinking. 
I'll take it back and exchange it for a larger size. 
(2) 
M: Have you noticed a brown folder here in your office? 
F: No, I haven't. Why do you ask? 
M: I brought one in here for our morning meeting, and 
haven't seen it since. 
F: You're welcome to look around, 
but I don't think it's here. 
(1) 
F: Excuse me¡Xdo you have this dress in a smaller size? 
M: Actually, I don't work in this department. 
I'll get one of my co-workers to help you. 
F: Thanks. And before you go, could you tell me where the 
bathroom is? 
M: It's in the back, next to the changing rooms. 

(13) 
M: I hope the weather is sunny tomorrow. 
F: Why? Have you made plans to do something outside? 
M: Tomorrow is the company softball game. 
Aren't you going to attend? 
F: I almost forgot! Thanks for reminding me! 
(12) 
F: Should I put this in the living room as well? 
M: No, actually that goes in the kitchen. 
And Francis, thanks for all your help today! 
F: No problem! I'm always happy to help a friend in need. 
By the way, this place is much nicer than your old place. 
(11) 
F: What about this one? What can you tell me about it? 
M: This is our latest model. 
It's got a 200 gigabyte hard drive, as well as a 17 inch 
screen. 
F: It certainly looks great! How much is it? 
M: Let me check with my manager. 
Hold on a minute, please. 
(10) 
M: I'm going to take my car to the repair shop this 
afternoon. 
F: Why? What's wrong with it? 
M: It's been making strange noises all week. 
I really need to take it in and find out what's going on. 
F: Good idea! Better safe than sorry. 
(9) 
F: I'm going to the video store right now. Any requests? 
M: Well, I haven't seen a scary movie in a while¡K 
F: That's a great idea! I'll see what I can find. 
And I'll rent a comedy DVD as well, just in case the 
movie is too scary! 
(8) 
M: Hello, this is Ned Flanders. 
I'm calling about the job posting in the Sunday 
newspaper. 
F: I'm sorry, but the ad specifically said that all 
applications must be sent by email. 
M: Oh, I hadn't noticed that. 
I'll send my resume this afternoon. 
Sorry for taking up your time. 

(20) 
M: That was the best movie I have ever seen! 
F: Really? I didn't like it at all. 
The first two movies in the series were much better. 
M: I disagree! 
In fact, I'm going to go back in and watch it again! 
F: Suit yourself. But you'll be going in alone this time. 
(19) 
M: Janey, do you have any relatives in Canada? 
F: Actually, I have an uncle who lives there. 
M: Have you ever visited him? 
F: Not since I was a child. 
(18) 
M: There's going to be a meeting today. 
F: Do you know what time? 
M: It's at 3pm. 
Be sure to inform everyone in your department. 
F: Thanks, I will. 
(17) 
M: I like the black ones better than the red ones. 
F: But the black ones have really dark lenses. 
I think they might be too dark. 
M: Yeah, I know what you mean. 
Light lenses make it easier to see in most situations. 
(16) 
M: This is the most interesting book I have ever read. 
F: What is it about? 
M: It's about curing diseases using food and herbs instead 
of drugs. 
F: Can I read it when you're finished? 
M: Sure, of course. 
(15) 
F: Did you know that Roy was transferred to the marketing 
department? 
M: No, this is the first I've heard of it. 
F: Yeah, it's too bad. 
We probably won't see much of him anymore. 
M: That is too bad. Roy is a great guy to have around. 
(14) 
M: Excuse me ma'am¡K this tomato soup is kind of cold. 
F: I'm sorry, I'll take it back to the kitchen and have it 
warmed up. 
M: Actually, I don't like the taste either. 
Can you bring me the chicken soup instead? 
F: Sure, no problem. 

(26) 
F: Excuse me, how do I get to the highway from here? 
M: Just keep driving, and after you cross that bridge, 
turn left. 
F: Okay... keep driving, turn left after the bridge, 
and then¡K? 
M: That's it! You should see a sign after the bridge. 
F: Thanks a lot! 
(25) 
F: Do you want to go to the night market with me? 
M: Well, what are you going to do there? 
F: Not much. I just want to go and try some new foods. 
M: Ok, I'll go, as long as you don't start shopping for 
clothes again. 
(24) 
F: Hey, have you seen my keys anywhere? 
M: I saw a set of keys on the kitchen counter earlier this 
morning. 
F: I checked there, but wasn't able to find them. 
M: Well, then I have no idea where they are. Sorry. 
(23) 
F: What kind of building is that? 
M: It is a Buddhist temple. 
F: It's very beautiful. 
I really like the wood carvings and big, red dragons. 
M: Yes, but unfortunately some parts of the temple are 
damaged. 
F: That's OK. It still looks beautiful to me. 
(22) 
M: Do you want to go to Oktoberfest with me this 
weekend? 
F: What is Oktoberfest? 
M: It is a special German celebration. 
F: What can we do there? 
M: We can dance, drink beer and eat German sausage. 
F: Sure, I would love to go! 
(21) 
F: What do you think of the new teacher? 
M: I don't like him. He is too strict. 
F: Well, I really respect him. I think he is a great teacher. 
M: Why do you respect him? 
F: Because he makes us work hard, and cares about us.
