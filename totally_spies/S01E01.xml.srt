(pop music)

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,720
Who is this Ricky Mathis chump, anyway? (chump=>foolish person)

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,280
I don't know,
but his fans sure seem to like him.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
We can't keep his lame,
pretty boy single on the shelf.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
(beep)

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
(banging and screaming)

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,160
(fans scream)

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
{\an8}CLOVER: Sammy, could I borrow
your cashmere belly sweater tomorrow? (belly sweater)

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,200
{\an8}Sure. Sure!
That's what best friends are for!

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Hey, what about me?

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
{\an8}Don't be crazy, Alex.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
{\an8}We can't wear Sam's sweater
at the same time. We'll stretch it out!

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,160
No, Clover I meant...
Aren't I your best friend, too?

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,160
(sighs)

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Well, of course you are, silly.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,200
And that's why I'm gonna borrow your
leopard print sandals tomorrow! (gasps) (leopard pronunciation)

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,760
(guitar strumming) (strum means play)

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,520
Clover, what is it? What's wrong?

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,560
(lightning cracks)

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
Yeah, what's with all the drool? (drool = to allow saliva to flow out of your mouth)

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think... I think I'm in love!

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Must find out who he is...

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,080
(guitar strumming)

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,720
Hi. I'm Clover.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,760
Is it me, or does Clover fall in love

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,960
more often than Mandy
maxes out her credit card? (does Clover fall in love often than Mandy maxes out her credit card?)

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,760
What do you say we go out after school?
I'll let you buy me a non-fat latte!

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
You will? OK.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
(lightning cracks)

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
Sorry, Clover.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,040
Damon's already got plans after school.
He's going to the mall with yours truly.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, yeah. That's right... The mall.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,480
(sirens)

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
Well, no big deal.

45 (***)
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
I was only trying to do him a favor
cos he's new around here.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Hmm!

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
SAM AND ALEX: Clover!

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,520
Don't worry, Clover, I'll buy you
a non-fat latte after school.

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,520
Besides, wouldn't you rather hang out
with us than some dim-witted musician? (dim-witted=stupid, silly)

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I guess so. Only...
I just can't help liking Damon.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Call me crazy, but I just have
this thing for musicians!

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,480
I've got to find a way to get his
attention off of Mandy and on to me!

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
(all scream)

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,920
(screaming continues)

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,120
Is it me or do our missions only occur
during times of major personal crisis?!

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,120
(all shriek)

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,160
Well, so nice of you girls to drop in.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
Nice for some of us.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
ALEX: Ricky Mathis. Never heard of him.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,440
JERRY: That's because
he's an overnight musical sensation.

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,480
In fact, as of today,
he's only released one single

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,360
the optimistically titled Rock Legend.

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Which makes it even more unsettling

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,040
there have been similar
occurrences around the globe.

65
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
Something's up,
we're just not sure what.

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,640
So, where do we fit in?

67
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Your mission is to go undercover
as the opening act on his world tour

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,480
and find out exactly what it is
about Ricky Mathis

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,480
that's making his fans so... fanatical.

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,960
You mean we get to be in a real band?!

71
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,960
A real pretend one.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,800
This is so perfect!

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,800
When Damon finds out,
he'll toss Mandy like a day-old muffin

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,760
and come running straight to me!

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,440
He'll see me as his musical equal!
I'll be irresistible!

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,960
Now, all we need is a name.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,680
Actually, ladies, we've already
taken care of your name.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,400
{\an8}CLOVER: We're called The Spies?
That is so lame.

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,040
ALEX: Yeah. Totally unimaginative.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,880
- It was my idea.
- GIRLS: Oh!

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Hey, look at these cool instruments!

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,200
(rock music)

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,160
(music ends)

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,800
Perhaps now isn't the best time
for you to er... practice.

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,360
Now. Where were we?

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
- The drop is ready, sir.
- Oh, yes, the gear.

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,720
This week you'll be utilizing
the Expandable Cable bungee belt,

88
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,440
the Wind Tunnel 3,000
Tornado Blast hairdryer,

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,520
the Suctioncup Bottomed go-go boots,
the Ultra-sensitive earring microphone,

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,840
and, my personal favorite, UPWATI.

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,040
Upwhaty?

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,680
No, no, not upwhaty, UPWATI.

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,040
Underwater power-walking apparatus
that's inconspicuous.

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,520
JERRY: Now, goodbye
and good luck, ladies.

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,720
Or, as they say in show biz,
break a leg.

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
(all scream)

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,800
Wow, look! We have fans already!

98
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
(Clover screams)

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,880
- GIRL: You're not Ricky!
- BOY: That's not him!

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,880
Wow. I guess Ricky Mathis is popular.

101
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
GIRLS: Wow!

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,320
I can't wait to tell Damon about this.
He'll be so impressed with me!

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,760
Is that all she thinks about?

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,400
- DAMON:<i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Hi, Damon. It's Clover.</i>

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,320
<i>Just thought I'd call to see</i>
<i>what's happening stateside.</i>

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,920
<i>I don't know what's going on stateside,</i>
<i>but I'm hanging out at the mall.</i>

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
<i>So, what's up with you, Clover?</i>

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,640
<i>Oh, the usual.</i>

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
<i>My band, The Spies,</i>
<i>is touring with Ricky Mathis.</i>

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,480
<i>We're hanging out at our extravagant and</i>
<i>glamorous hotel in London right now.</i>

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,000
<i>Whoa! You're on tour with Ricky Mathis?</i>
<i>I had no idea you were even in a band.</i>

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,680
<i>Oh, yeah. I'm quite</i>
<i>an accomplished guitar...erist.</i>

113
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,520
<i>Wow! Awesome.</i>

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,640
<i>Hey! Maybe when you get back we can</i>
<i>get together and jam or something.</i>

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
<i>I could probably</i>
<i>squeeze you in next week.</i>

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,800
I'll let you know. Bye.

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,080
You must be The Spies.

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,680
Spies, that's ridiculous!
Who told you we were spies?

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, that's us, The Spies. We rock.

120
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,480
Well, I am Phil Jenkins,
the tour manager.

121
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,400
Ricky's very anxious to meet you.

122
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,200
What do you say we
head up to the penthouse?

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,360
(guitar strumming)

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,320
- CLOVER: Great song.
- Thanks. I just wrote it.

125
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,480
We're scheduled to record Ricky's
new song tomorrow morning.

126
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm sure it'll be his next big hit.

127
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
We're sure it will be too.

128
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,280
We're thrilled to be touring
with such a great musical talent.

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,040
The feeling's mutual.
I just adore your early work.

130
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,640
- We have early work?
- Shh!

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,240
You should come to the recording studio
and hang out, it'll be a blast!

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,760
Sorry, Ricky, your recording sessions
are strictly off limits.

133
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,600
Sounds like fun! We'd love to go!

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,200
Great.

135
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,320
OK, everybody, we don't want
to keep those hungry fans waiting.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,120
Ooopsie.

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,840
Hmm!

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,080
That's weird, since when do CDs glow?

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,200
So, besides the fact that he has
totally crazed fans and glowing CDs,

140
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Ricky seems pretty normal to me.

141
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
Ouch!

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,560
{\an8}CROWD: Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Well, here goes nothing.
You ready, Clover?

144
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,680
SAM: Clover? You're not supposed
to be listening to music,

145
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
you're supposed to be playing it!

146
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,320
Besides, I took Ricky's CD for evidence.

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,280
Too bad, cos I totally dig it.
It's really... infectious.

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,840
(cheering)

149
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,800
Wow!

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
(rock music)

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
Hey, we sound great!

152
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah, that's because
the music's pre-recorded!

153
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,480
In case you haven't noticed,
none of us are singing

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,200
and your guitars aren't even
hooked up to amplifiers!

155
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,680
(cheering)

156
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,000
I guess they won't be wanting an encore.

157
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,120
RICKY: Nice job lip-synching.
Took me forever to get it right.

158
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
You lip-synch, Ricky?

159
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,600
I don't like to,
but Phil insists that I don't sing live.

160
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,560
I guess I can't argue with success.

161
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
(cheering)

162
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
ALEX: So much for the theory
about Ricky being normal.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
The guy doesn't even sing!

164
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
It's not the only thing
that isn't normal.

165
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
Check that out, girls.

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,480
SAM: What do you say
we grab a spies-eye view?

167
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
ALEX: Good idea.

168
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,120
Clover, you coming?

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Are you crazy?
I've got a killer view right here.

170
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,400
It's Spy time!

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
(cheering)

172
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,680
PHIL: Yeah, Mr Sebastian, everything is
a go for tomorrow's recording session.

173
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,680
I've prepared the special lyrics.

174
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,000
Unfortunately, Ricky invited those
pesky Spies to come along.

175
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
We'll have to keep tight security. Huh?

176
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,880
Oh! Hey, hey, girls! What's wrong?
Aren't you having fun?

177
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,040
Hey, I think I've gone deaf.

178
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
Actually, the booth is soundproof.

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,960
The noise night after night
gives me a headache.

180
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
I prefer just to watch.

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,560
{\an8}(lightning cracks)

182
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,440
{\an8}SAM: So, let's review,

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
Ricky's fans are nuts,

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
his CDs glow, he doesn't sing,

185
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,960
and his manager sits in
a soundproof booth during his shows.

186
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Getting freaky.
What do you think, Clover?

187
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,640
I think Ricky was incredible!
I mean, he's so talented.

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,480
I could just listen to him all night...

189
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,560
- CLOVER: Must hear Ricky.
- SAM AND ALEX: Wow!

190
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
OK. This is weird.
Maybe we should check it out with...

191
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
ALEX AND SAM: Jerry?!

192
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,520
Hello, ladies. I hope rock stardom
hasn't gone to your heads.

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,120
It hasn't so far but if we keep getting
showered with roses, it might.

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,360
<i>Oh, those...</i>
<i>They were sent by one Damon Reynolds.</i>

195
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Hey, Clover, the flowers are for you!
Damon sent them!

196
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,040
Please. Now I'm involved with Ricky,
I'm, like, so over Damon!

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh man, how deluded can you get?
Not to mention fickle.

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
So, anyway, Jerry,

199
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,040
<i>what can you tell us about</i>
<i>a Mr Sebastian?</i>

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
<i>Says here he's the owner of</i>
<i>Ricky Mathis' record label.</i>

201
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,240
<i>Apparently, he used to be quite</i>
<i>the successful guitar player</i>

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,520
<i>before he lost his arm in</i>
<i>a freak pyrotechnics accident.</i>

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
(all scream)

204
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,760
<i>Now he's an eccentric recluse producer</i>

205
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,480
<i>who lives on a remote island</i>
<i>off the coast of Brazuela.</i>

206
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,640
- Ricky!
- So...

207
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,160
RICKY: Who's ready to go to
my recording studio in Brazuela?

208
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
Wow!

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
SAM: I wonder what was up with
that strange radio tower thing

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
being strapped to the yacht?

211
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
ALEX: Ricky says it's so they can
broadcast the concert live.

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
SAM: I don't buy it. Since when do you
need guards to watch a satellite dish?

213
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,320
ALEX: This is definitely the creepiest
recording studio I've ever seen.

214
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
(guitar strumming)

215
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,880
That was great, Ricky.

216
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,960
CLOVER:<i>Yeah, it was totally excellent!</i>

217
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,720
(Alex and Sam groan)

218
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
Now, why don't we lay down the lyrics?

219
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,880
RICKY:<i>"I'm Ricky and I'm your master.</i>
<i>Follow me as I spread disaster."</i>

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,880
<i>"Take over the government, do as I say.</i>
<i>I'll rule the world and you'll obey."</i>

221
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,480
Phil, I sort of didn't intend
for the new song to be so... aggressive.

222
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,440
What happened to the lyrics I wrote?

223
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,880
Ricky, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

224
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,720
These new lyrics will give your song
that hip, edgy feel

225
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
the kids are so wild about these days.

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,520
OK, I'd say those definitely fall
under the special-lyrics category.

227
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,840
All the lyrics Ricky sings are special.

228
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,840
Maybe we should take this opportunity
to do a little spying.

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm right behind ya.

230
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,560
(whispers) I just love it
when fashion has a purpose.

231
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,400
(gasps)

232
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,560
(both gasp)

233
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,840
The secret laboratory's
got to be around here somewhere.

234
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,960
(Alex screams)

235
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Nice work, Alex.

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
ALEX: Yeah. Anytime.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
The new Ricky single is all finished.

238
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,760
MR. SEBASTIAN: Excellent.

239
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,960
SCIENTIST: The frequency
has been successfully added.

240
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,400
Good! Now let's see
the effects firsthand.

241
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,600
I take it the guy with
the scary hook is Sebastian.

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
And I take it he doesn't
play guitar much these days.

243
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Have a seat. We want to know
what you think of this new song.

244
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
(music)

245
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,680
You're Ricky and you're my master.
I'll follow you as you spread disaster.

246
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,720
Take over the government, do as you say.
You'll rule the world and I'll obey.

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
You're dismissed.

248
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,000
You're Ricky and you're my master.
I'll follow you as you spread disaster

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,920
Did you see that? It's like...

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,040
It's like Ricky's song hypnotized
that guy or something!

251
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,000
The frequency they were talking about

252
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,520
must be a subliminal
mind control device.

253
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,720
That would explain why Clover's
been acting so crazy!

254
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,320
- Huh?
- Think about it.

255
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,520
Ricky's first song, Rock Legend,

256
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,480
is about rock star worship
and what does it do?

257
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,240
It hypnotizes listeners
into worshipping him!

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
They do whatever
the lyrics tell them to!

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,600
So that means,
if Ricky performs at the concert

260
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,080
the fans will do
whatever the lyrics say!

261
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,640
(screams)

262
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
Security! We have intruders!

263
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
(both scream)

264
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,960
ALEX AND SAM: Run!

265
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,520
Nice gadget. What was that,
a portable high viscosity oil canon?

266
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
That was no gadget,
that was my favorite mousse!

267
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,520
Expensive, too.

268
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,360
You're Ricky and you're my master.

269
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,600
Quick! We can scale down the wall!

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,280
(both groan)

271
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,720
So, The Spies are really... spies.

272
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,880
How totally lame and unimaginative.

273
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Don't blame us. Jerry thought of it.

274
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,240
Unfortunately, you'll never have
a chance to report what you've learned

275
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,160
because in approximately 20 seconds,

276
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,040
the only thing you'll be interested in
will be the worshipping of Ricky Mathis.

277
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,680
Which means that tonight you won't mind

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,040
when I jam all the radio, TV,
and Internet signals around the globe.

279
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,760
Nor will it bother you when
I take control of the world

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,400
with my newly-hypnotized slaves,
because you'll be two of them.

281
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,440
Enjoy your last moments of free will.

282
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,480
(buzzing)

283
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,760
(evil laughter)

284
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,600
(pop music)

285
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
Great. Now what are we gonna do?

286
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,200
We can use those to get out!

287
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
(groans)

288
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
No. Not like that.

289
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,240
(rock music)

290
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Wow, this UPWATI is really great.

291
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Upwhaty?

292
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Don't start that again!

293
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
SAM: Now let's get to the concert
before it's too late.

294
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
ALEX: I'm getting really sick
of this salt water.

295
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,360
It totally frizzes my hair.

296
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,680
CROWD: Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

297
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,480
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

298
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,960
(chanting continues)

299
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
ALEX: Psst! Ricky!

300
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be out there playing.

301
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,080
Well, we would be, except your
good friends Phil and Sebastian

302
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
decided to lock us in a recording booth

303
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,360
and use a hypnotic version of your new
song to try and turn us into zombies!

304
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,120
Alex, fill him in.
I've get to get to that radio tower!

305
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,040
Now, let's go watch the fireworks!

306
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,280
OK! How the heck am I
gonna stop the broadcast?

307
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
Sebastian planned on using my music
to take over some government?

308
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
Actually, he planned on using you
to rule the world.

309
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
Weren't you paying attention?

310
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
There he is!

311
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
(fans scream)

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,760
MR SEBASTIAN: Where's Ricky?
He should be playing by now.

313
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
This crowd is ready to start a riot.

314
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
PHIL: We can't wait.
I'll start the music by remote.

315
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,360
CROWD: Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

316
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,240
CROWD:
You are Ricky and you're our master.

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,080
Oh, no!

318
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,520
(fans yell)

319
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,960
- RICKY: What do we do now?
- Looks like the only way out is up!

320
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,360
What the...?

321
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,080
That's it! Time to get rid of those
annoying spies once and for all.

322
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,960
(pop music)

323
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
What's going on here?

324
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,000
Somehow we've picked up
the signal of Ricky's recording.

325
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,040
That's not supposed to happen!
Quick, turn the monitors off.

326
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,640
No, don't shut them off.

327
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,640
Ricky's music is so... wonderful.

328
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
(groans)

329
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,400
BOTH: You're Ricky
and you're our master.

330
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
You're Ricky and you're our master.

331
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,880
CROWD: You're Ricky
and you're our master.

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,680
(yelling)

333
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
Don't worry, girls,
we'll take over from here.

334
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,200
BOTH: You're Ricky
and you're our master...

335
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,640
You're Ricky and you're our...

336
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,080
Gee. Thanks, Jerry,
and not a minute too soon.

337
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,880
These vicious criminals
were just about to force Ricky

338
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,000
to autograph their concert T-shirts.

339
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,200
CLOVER: I can't believe
I fell for Ricky Mathis.

340
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm, like, so embarrassed.

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You weren't thinking straight.

342
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,080
SAM: Luckily the effects
of the music wore off

343
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,080
and you're not a zombie groupie anymore.

344
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,640
Hey! Clover, you're back!
Did you get my flowers?

345
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah, I got them.

346
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,640
So, I was thinking,
maybe we could get together

347
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,480
and you could tell me about
your tour with Ricky Mathis.

348
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,120
Sorry, Damon. After the tour experience,
I'm like, so over musicians.

349
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,080
(crow caws)

350
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm so proud of you, Clover.

351
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,640
Yeah, you've finally
come to your senses.

352
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
I just decided it's really dumb

353
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,160
to fall for every guy
with a guitar in his hands.

354
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
Excuse me, can anyone tell me
where the music room is?

355
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
I'm new and I'm kinda lost.

356
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,280
I'd be happy to take you
to the music room.

357
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,160
I guess this means
she's back into musicians.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,400
Something tells me
she never got over them.

359
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,400
CLOVER: If you don't have lunch plans,

360
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,280
you can buy me a non-fat latte
and I'll give you a tour of the school!
