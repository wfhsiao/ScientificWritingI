Oh!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Out of the way!
Grandpa here lost his nerve.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,680
Come on, I'm psyched to see
how fast this thing is!

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,320
LOUDSPEAKER:<i>Let's see how you like</i>
<i>getting pushed around, Bret!</i>

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,480
Hey, what's up with this?
(screams)

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,800
LOUDSPEAKER:<i>Bret has been a bad boy.</i>
<i>Bret needs a lesson.</i>

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040
{\an8}Sam, Alex, this Court has no choice

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,000
{\an8}but to find you guilty of
violating the school dress code.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,320
{\an8}But Clov... your Honor,

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,520
{\an8}our heels are only a half-inch higher
than the code allows.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,320
Can't you give us a break?

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,480
Well, considering the circumstances,

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,240
I guess I can let you off with
a suspended sentence.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
- Objection, Your Dis-Honor!
- (screams)

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
This is total favoritism!

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,840
I agree. You're much too lenient
to be a student court judge, Clover.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm replacing you with Mandy.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,880
Thank you, Ms Brooks. I promise
I'll restore dignity to this cour...

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,920
And I'll restore integrity, too.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,880
This court finds all three of you
in contempt,

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,680
and sentences you to three weeks
of picking up trash!

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
Next case!

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
ALL: What?!

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,360
"Integrity?" Ha! What a brown-noser!

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,480
Yeah! Who's she think she is,
the Supreme Court?

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,720
Ew! This is, like, supremely nasty!

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
There must be a way
to pick this stuff up faster.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
There is, check it out!

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,640
(all scream)

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
Can't you get a normal office?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Sorry, ladies, but we need you urgently.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
14 hours ago, a computer trapped

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,080
a student named Bret Brinkley
on a Las Vegas rollercoaster.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
(Bret sobs)

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
We've had two similar attacks.

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,960
In Italy, a tourist was attacked by
an airport baggage machine.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,000
And a computerized elevator
at Silicon Valley High

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
left the principal quite shook-up.

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
(principal grunts)

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,880
Yikes. More proof
that climbing stairs is healthier.

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
Your first stop is Las Vegas.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,840
Today's gadgets menu includes
decoy purse, life raft, parachute...

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,200
Don't spray on that perfume.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,600
It's liquid nitrogen. It freezes
steel, makes it as brittle as glass.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,000
Extremely cool!

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Careful, the hairdryer is
an infrared heat-ray.

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
The stereo is a sonic disintegrator
and the camera fires a laser beam.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,960
- (gasps)
- Guess I won't need film, will I?

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,920
{\an8}(Bret screams)

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Looks like Bret's had enough fun,
get ready to grab him!

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
Careful, here he comes. Go time!

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,040
(Bret screams)

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,640
(screams)

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,280
Come on, pal,
time to give someone else a turn.

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,720
Remind me to stick to the merry-go-round
next time we go to an amusement park.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,520
(sobbing) Thank you!

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I don't get it. How could
a computer voice know your name?

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,880
Search me.
I'm on the football team, babe.

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,120
I don't study computers,
or anything else.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,560
- Football?
- Yeah. I bet you ace all your tests.

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,560
I don't have to, babe.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,400
I just grab the nearest nerd
and, uh, "persuade" him to help me.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Speaking as a nerd, I'm starting to see
why computers attack you.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
What do you mean, computers?
You talk like there's more than one.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,960
In case you haven't noticed,

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,160
this hotel is holding
the annual computerized gadget show.

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,960
(all scream)

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,480
Why are they coming at me like that?

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,400
COMPUTER VOICE:<i>Naughty, naughty, Bret.</i>
<i>Your punishment isn't over!</i>

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
OK, say cheese.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,080
Oopsie, wrong camera.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,000
Get out of the way!

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,480
<i>- Bret has been a bad boy...</i>
<i>-</i>(screams)

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,160
-<i>Bret needs a lesson!</i>
- Time for you to split, honey!

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
SAM: There's never an energy crisis
when you need one!

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
<i>Bret has been a bad boy!</i>

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,080
OK, who's next?

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Chill, Alex. You got 'em all.

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,720
It's like those computers knew Bret,
we gotta get him somewhere safe.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll have WOOHP agents pick him up.

90
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,400
We have to get to Italy, before
anything else happens to that gym coach.

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,560
(gasps)

92
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Oh, you want some, Mr Machine?

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Victim number two, Coach Joe Hassler
has been laying low here

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,000
on the Isle of Capri
ever since he got baggage-handled.

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,400
Look, I've never been to Vegas,
I don't know this Bret kid

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
and I don't wanna go anywhere.

97
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
You'll be safer at WOOHP.

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,760
But cars, planes, ships,
they all have computer chips now!

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
If computers are out to get me,
how do I travel?

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
SPIES: Hmm...

101
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,080
Hey! This is what I call low-tech.

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
This funicular railway is powered by
a cable. No computer on board.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
(all yell)

104
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
Uh, Sam, does that go for the
cable motors down in the station?

105
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm guessing the answer is no!

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,800
COMPUTER VOICE:<i>You've been a bad</i>
<i>boy, Coach. Time for your punishment!</i>

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,200
(coach yells)

108
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,000
COACH: Help!

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Look out!

110
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
(man yells)

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,280
- The brake lever is jammed!
- Oh, we are so dead!

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,160
We can still trip the brake if we
climb outside to reach the wheel.

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,680
Like I said, we're dead!

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,320
Clover!

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,640
- OK, time for plan B!
- Do we even have a Plan B?

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
We do now. It's called... jump!

117
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
(loud crash)

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,120
This may be a dumb question to ask a
gym coach, but do you have any enemies?

119
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,800
- Only every kid I ever taught.
- Any who were good with computers?

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,040
Well, I had this one geek running laps
all last year. I forgot his name.

121
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,840
He transferred to Silicon Valley.

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,400
Silicon Valley High? Isn't that
where victim number three is principal?

123
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,880
That's it! The coach picks on kids
at one school, Bret at another.

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,920
What if they both bullied the same
kid who's now at Silicon Valley? Mm...

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,440
Time to pay a visit to
Silicon Valley High.

126
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,680
We can drop the coach off
at WOOHP on the way.

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
(men groan)

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,760
(all yell)

129
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,360
(groans) Every time I think
Jerry can't come up with

130
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,600
a more annoying way for us to travel,
he outdoes himself.

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,240
Wow... Silicon Valley High makes
our school look so...

132
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,640
So 20th Century.

133
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
How can we blend in
so we don't look so suspicious?

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,120
By not blending in. Let's take
a backstage tour of their auditorium.

135
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
Wow, look at all that!

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Yeah!

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,920
Uh, sorry,
Principal Veegun is out sick today.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
(English accent)
Oh, dear. Can you 'elp us, luv?

139
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,400
We're new exchange students!
I'm Samantha, from England.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Alexandra from Russia.
Is enrolling in school we want.

141
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
I am Cloverpatra, from Egypt.

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Hi, I'm Adam Lewis.
Those clothes look familiar.

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,360
You've never, uh,
done a school play here, have you?

144
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,560
- Nyit. We are just arriving.
- (giggles)

145
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,240
A thousand pardons, effendi. We wish to
meet other students who are new here.

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,680
Could we see your, how you say,
database of new arrivals?

147
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
Sure, let me input my password.
Just don't tell the principal, OK?

148
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,400
"CHAD?"

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,960
CHAD stands for Computer Home Analyzer
and Defender. My invention.

150
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,280
He... it... can access
any computer anywhere.

151
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,120
I spend a lot of time on CHAD
cos Dad's always moving us.

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,000
I guess we both know how hard it is to
make friends when you're new in school.

153
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,920
All those bullies and snobs...

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
(normal accent) Yeah, sure.

155
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,680
(Egyptian accent)
Excuse me, I am busy.

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,640
Adam! I warned you about using
my computer to download games

157
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,000
or whatever it is you do!
I'm revoking your access permanently.

158
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,760
What?! But Principal Veegun,
you can't do that!

159
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,520
No? Watch me. Now get out!

160
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
And would you three explain?

161
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,080
Mrs Veegun, you shouldn't have
come back. You're in huge danger!

162
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,960
Danger? From whom?

163
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,240
Aw, man, I can't play with the school
mainframe anymore, CHAD!

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,720
<i>Don't worry, Adam. I already</i>
<i>uploaded instructions to it.</i>

165
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
<i>Vera Veegun won't bother us again.</i>

166
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
(door slams)

167
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,760
Are your door locks computerized?

168
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,680
Yes. Windows, too. Why do you ask?

169
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,840
(shutters slam / all scream)

170
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,440
And your sprinklers!

171
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
Hey, CHAD? What's going on?

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>Just a little prank, Adam.</i>
<i>I'll show you when we get home.</i>

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,880
Sam! I left my laser camera backstage
when I changed clothes!

174
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,720
Oh, no! And I left the boom-box!
Wait, I've still got my fanny pack.

175
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,920
CHAD:<i>You've been a bad girl, Vera.</i>
<i>Now I have to punish you!</i>

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,360
There's that creepy voice
that loves to dish out punishment.

177
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,000
You're worried about a copier?

178
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,600
No, I'm worried about its stapler!

179
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,160
- (gasps)
- How long can you keep that up?

180
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,560
Won't need to for long,
in a minute we're gonna run out of air.

181
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,080
Sam, give me your pack!

182
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,520
Hang on, we're hitting white water!

183
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
(all scream)

184
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
You OK?

185
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm going to the faculty lounge.
I just need to faint for a while.

186
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,640
Ten students transferred here.
And one was Adam.

187
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,000
But could any kid hack into
so many systems, so fast?

188
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,320
It's not humanly possible.

189
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,240
Wait a sec, that voice we keep
hearing doesn't sound human.

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,280
Maybe our hacker isn't human!

191
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
Jerry, we have ten suspects,
but if you run a check on...

192
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,120
<i>Later, Sam. Someone in Silicon Valley</i>
<i>just used the Internet</i>

193
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>to hack into a missile base on Guam.</i>
<i>I'll send a jet to pick you up.</i>

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,800
Sergeant Clover, relieving you, sir.

195
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,600
General wishes to see you
on the double, sir.

196
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,720
We gotta stop those missiles!
Get back!

197
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
(screams)

198
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,240
Uh-oh. I've seen that password before.

199
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,080
<i>Sorry, girls, you're not</i>
<i>going to interfere this time.</i>

200
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>Excuse me now,</i>
<i>I have some schools to vaporize.</i>

201
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,280
(gasps) We're running out of time!

202
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,040
Oops, did I mess that up for you?

203
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
SPIES: Yeah!

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,200
<i>Clever. But all you've done is</i>
<i>buy a few hours.</i>

205
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,800
<i>I'll just infiltrate another silo.</i>
<i>And you're not going anywhere.</i>

206
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,760
Where's that instant metal freezer?

207
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,040
Let's get back to Silicon Valley.

208
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,600
The only way to stop this,
is to find that hacker.

209
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Our suspects narrowed to one.

210
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,600
Adam's password is
the name of his invention, "CHAD."

211
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,000
- (computer bleeps)
- What are you running?

212
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,880
<i>Oh, I ran those so-called exchange</i>
<i>students through some databases.</i>

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,000
You mean Samantha,
Alexandra and...

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,600
<i>I mean Sam, Alex and Clover.</i>
<i>They're from Beverly Hills High.</i>

215
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,120
Those liars!

216
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,640
CHAD, I want you to mess
their grades up so bad

217
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,800
- they get put back in kindergarten!
-<i>No problem.</i>

218
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,200
<i>Put on my virtual reality helmet</i>
<i>and you can see all our latest pranks.</i>

219
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,800
Wait a sec, I asked you to
prank everyone, but...

220
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,680
...you've been hurting them instead!

221
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,040
Coach Hassler
and Principal Veegun and Bret.

222
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,960
<i>Yes, the ones who hurt us.</i>

223
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,240
<i>They've been bad...</i>
<i>they must be punished.</i>

224
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,360
And now you're... you're gonna
fire missiles at all my old schools?!

225
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,480
<i>You wished they could be destroyed.</i>
<i>All those bullies and snobs.</i>

226
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,680
But I was mad when I said that! I just
wanted to prank everyone, not hurt them!

227
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,360
CHAD:
<i>No. We're in this together now, Adam.</i>

228
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
<i>We need to share your mind,</i>
<i>your creativity, your body.</i>

229
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,360
You're right, CHAD. Combined with your
power, nothing on Earth can stop us.

230
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,560
Target those schools
and prepare for countdown.

231
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
No one picked up. The message says
his father is out of town.

232
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,640
- You think Adam's setting a trap?
- Not Adam. That thing he invented.

233
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,080
You said it yourself, Alex,
the hacker is too fast to be human.

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,320
It travels on the Internet, controls
other computers... That's the answer!

235
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
CHAD thinks for itself!

236
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,600
An evil computer with a mind of its own?
That is so creepy.

237
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
SPIES: Whoa!

238
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,880
We have to pull CHAD's plug.
A t the source. We all set?

239
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,440
Adam programmed CHAD for home defense.
So, think stealth.

240
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,720
Yee-hah!

241
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,320
SAM: Whoa!

242
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,440
(klaxon alarm blares)

243
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,560
Busted!

244
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,120
- Look out!
- (mechanical barking)

245
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,280
Launching purse decoy!

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,960
(growling)

247
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,880
(mechanical snarl)

248
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,360
(mechanical barking)

249
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,960
(all gasp)

250
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,280
CLOVER: The heck with stealth. (yells)

251
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,560
<i>Stage two intruders.</i>
<i>Initiate arctic defense..</i>

252
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,800
(whooshing)

253
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,160
Not exactly a warm welcome!

254
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
I bet that's Adam's room!

255
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,480
(both scream)

256
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
(screams)

257
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,560
<i>Finally, the silos are open.</i>
<i>Locked on to target-schools.</i>

258
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
(gasps) CHAD's launching missiles
at Adam's schools!

259
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
<i>Ten seconds to ignition... nine...</i>

260
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
SAM: Adam, are you in there?

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,920
- CHAD:<i>Eight...</i>
- (crash)

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>Those girls have been bad.</i>
<i>They must be punished. Seven...</i>

263
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,360
(all scream)

264
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,440
Aim for the power cord!

265
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Yeah! Huh?

266
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,040
<i>Sorry, girls, we have</i>
<i>a back-up generator. Six...</i>

267
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,040
This vacuum... really sucks!

268
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
Adam, help us!

269
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,040
Huh? What? Can't hear you...

270
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,160
CHAD:<i>Five...</i>

271
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,560
Yes, you can! Use your will power!

272
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,680
You can't let CHAD win!

273
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,440
CHAD:<i>Tisk-tisk. Four...</i>

274
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,400
<i>So, you're trying to betray me, Adam?</i>

275
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,480
<i>Very well. I'll retarget</i>
<i>the missiles to this house.</i>

276
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,480
<i>And upload myself to a new computer</i>
<i>at the Pentagon. Two...</i>

277
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,360
<i>One... zero!</i>

278
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
(spies struggle)

279
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
(air whistles)

280
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,080
(grunts)

281
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,320
(both) Yeah!

282
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,040
<i>Too little, too late. And now, farew...</i>

283
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>Adam, you shorted out my uplink.</i>

284
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,240
Come on, we got about ten seconds!

285
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,040
<i>Adam, you can't abandon me.</i>
<i>I order you to come back... stop...</i>

286
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
What have I done? I made a monster
who almost destroyed us all.

287
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
You didn't know what CHAD was doing.

288
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,520
I was just scared
you wouldn't snap out of it.

289
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,240
You think that was scary? In a few
hours, we have to face Judge Mandy.

290
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,440
(groans)

291
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,800
OK, whoa! This is contempt of court!

292
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,960
Mandy, enough is enough.

293
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,920
Tell me about it. I'll sentence them
to six weeks picking up trash.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,920
No, you won't. You have utterly failed
to enforce the dress code.

295
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
You are off the student court!

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, really? Well, if I'm not judge
anymore, then I demand a new job!

297
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,800
Mandy, you missed a milk carton.

298
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
(growls)

299
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
(squeals)

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,240
Sour milk! Run!

301
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
(groans)
