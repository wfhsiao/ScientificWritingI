And how may I help you?

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,800
Let's see. Well, for starters,

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,600
you can hand over all the cash
you got in this dump.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Nobody move!

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
(coughing)

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,480
ALL:<i>Cheese!</i>

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,160
{\an8}(school bell rings)

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,360
- Ta-da!
- (both gasp)

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,800
- So, what do you think?
- Well, your outfit is very... bright.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm hoping it'll remind that hot new
transfer student of his homeland.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,720
- Where's he from again?
- Texas.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
OK, here goes.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,240
So, Billy Bob.
If you're not too busy tomorrow night,

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,560
maybe you'd like to go line dancing
with me. Beverly Hills style, that is.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Well, that's mighty hospitable of you,
Mandy. I'd love to.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,120
Great.
I'll pick you up at eight o'clock.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,760
How dare you steal my look!

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Please. I was into Texas way before you.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah! Mandy practically invented
the rhinestone.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
Totally.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Besides, Billy's made up his mind.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,520
(screams)

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,200
That girl is a fashion thief and she is
not going to get away with this.

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,400
- What the...
- (all scream)

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,360
Terrific! The last thing I need right
now is another...

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
..stupid WOOHP spy mission!

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
(all gasp)

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,560
- Ouch!
- What's this all about, Jerry?

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,760
I think you girls know
what this is all about.

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
ALL:<i>Cheese!</i>

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,440
Is this some kind of sick joke?
That's not us robbing that bank.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,320
I am very disappointed in you girls.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
(sighs)

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,680
Throw these girls into
the electromagnetic holding tank

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,400
until we can reprogram them.

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,440
What do you mean, "reprogram"?

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,680
We're going to implant Behavioral
Modification Chips into your brains.

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,880
You'll never have another
aggressive thought as long as you live.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,120
- No, you guys, don't!
- Get your hands off me!

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
CLOVER: Jerry, help us!

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Sorry, girls. It's out of my hands.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,200
ALEX: These gaudy electromagnetic
boots are so cyber-repulsive.

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Not as repulsive as getting microchips
implanted into our skulls.

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,520
We gotta bust out and find those cheap
knock-off bank robbers

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
so we can clear our names.

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,920
(scoffs) Good luck.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
Hang on. I've got a plan.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,880
CLOVER: Hey, what gives?

58
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,160
(screams)
Wow, you short-circuited the boots!

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,680
I can move my feet again.

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,200
SAM: Great, but we're still stuck
in this cell.

61
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
- Not for long.
- (shrieks)

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
Huh?

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,320
CLOVER: Bet Mandy's shoes
wouldn't do that.

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
They're escaping. Code nine! Code nine!

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,240
(alarm blares)

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,720
JERRY:<i>Grab them so I can implant</i>
<i>the microchips into their skulls.</i>

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,360
SAM: In here!

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,760
Quick. Grab whatever you can. We're
gonna need all the help we can get.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Yeah!

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
(all shriek)

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Just relax, girls.
It'll all be over with soon.

72
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,960
Now!

73
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,280
CLOVER: How are we gonna lose them?

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,600
SAM: Time to fly, girls.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,280
How do I make this thing go?
I can't even set my digital watch.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,120
CLOVER: Just do something!

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,560
(all scream)

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
(they gasp)

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
ALL: Whoa!

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
I can't believe Jerry almost
microwaved my brain.

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
We'd better get out of the air.
We stick out like a sore thumb.

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,440
Put it down next to that warehouse.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,560
I said NEXT to the warehouse.

84
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,080
Something reeks here,
and I don't mean Alex's flying skills.

85
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,840
SAM: Oh, gross! There's our culprit.

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,320
Whoa! Look, my hairclip is actually
a high-tech frisbee.

87
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,760
That's no frisbee.
It's a mini-satellite.

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,760
We can use this to link
to WOOHP's computer system.

89
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Maybe we can get a closer look
at the footage Jerry showed us.

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,600
We're in.

91
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Wait, go back.
Watch the Clover imposter.

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,920
CLOVER: She left a shred of my shirt...
uh, I mean, her shirt on that cactus.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Maybe it's still there.

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,880
Too bad we're not allowed in that bank.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,720
Maybe there's a way to get inside
the bank without raising suspicion.

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,240
CLOVER: So much
for not raising suspicions.

97
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
SAM: Just act confident.

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,920
ALEX: That's easy for you to say.
You're not dressed like a waiter.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,720
SAM: You're not a waiter, you're our
driver. Just look for the shirt piece.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,880
MAN: Hello, sir, madam.
Can I help you with something?

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Oh, we're just looking
at your lovely financial place

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
to decide if we want to deposit

103
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,480
all of our... stocks
and... municipal... things here.

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,480
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

105
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,680
Uh, that would be quite impossible.

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,280
You see, we just moved here
from... Swedenavia.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,920
Swedenavia?

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
Oh, yes. Very small country. Very cold.

109
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes! I found it!

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
Found what? I'm sorry, found what?

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Oh, our driver seems to have found...
the lost keys to our limo.

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,600
Yes, we simply must be going now.
The country club awaits. Ta-ta.

113
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Sir, you forgot your... mustache?

114
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,480
Wait a second.
They were the bank robbers!

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,880
This is weird.
It almost feels like... flesh.

116
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,800
SAM: Look. The fabric contains
traces of human DNA!

117
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
No wonder it feels like flesh.

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Why would someone wear a shirt
made out of flesh?

119
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,240
I can't imagine that would breathe
very well in warm weather.

120
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Look, she didn't rip her shirt.
She ripped her... skin.

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,360
- Ew.
- There's something else here. Writing.

122
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,320
SAM: "Replatech Industries"?
What does that mean?

123
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,920
Let's check out the WOOHP database.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Apparently they're the medical lab
that created this creepy material.

125
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,480
I think it's time we pay Replatech
a visit. Uh, I'll drive.

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,400
I'd better cloak the Heli-Jet so we can
make a stealthy landing on the roof.

127
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
(all scream)

128
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
Oopsy.

129
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
ALEX: Wow! Now, that's impressive.

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,800
Check it out. Some sort of force field.

131
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,160
SAM: Whatever it is,
those birds didn't set off the alarms.

132
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,440
It must be set to detect any metal
that breaks its field.

133
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,800
How are we going to investigate the
building without giving ourselves away?

134
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,320
Why do I always get the cruddy jobs?

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,920
SAM:<i>We're getting a picture.</i>

136
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,680
OK, ew! What is that?
It looks like someone's farming humans.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
(screams) Bring me up!

138
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
<i>Bring me up!</i>

139
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
What's wrong with Alex?

140
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
(both scream)

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,720
We got company.

142
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
ALEX:<i>Hello?</i>

143
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,640
Girl on a rope down here! Pull me up!

144
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,160
(screams)

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Need a lift?

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,520
No. I need a barf bag!

147
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,120
Phew! That was close.

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Close?! Hello, in case no one noticed,

149
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
I just got tossed around
like a human yo-yo.

150
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
Not to mention getting grabbed by...
What's this?

151
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,880
- Looks like a fingernail.
- I have a hunch.

152
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,360
Use the Compowder
to check its composition.

153
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,120
It's made of the same substance
as the skin we found. But get this.

154
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,000
- The DNA matches Clover's DNA.
- OK, no way!

155
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,480
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing
that cheesy sea foam nail polish.

156
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,920
ALL: The intruders have escaped, sir.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
MAN: So, the spies are on to me.

158
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,040
I underestimated them.
It won't happen again.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,880
So what's the connection between
the DNA, the robbery and Replatech?

160
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,160
I don't know,
but I hope we figure it out soon.

161
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,480
The prospect of spending another minute
in this warehouse is...

162
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,640
(crashing)

163
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,000
WOOHP must have tracked us.

164
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Give it up, girls.
We have the place surrounded.

165
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Scatter, quick!

166
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Keep a tight perimeter.
Don't let them get away.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
(sighs) What the...

168
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
- Psst!
- Huh?

169
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
Sammy, you made it.
Have you seen Clover?

170
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Right here.

171
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,560
Are you feeling alright?

172
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,600
- Of course.
- What now?

173
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
We have to get back to Replatech
and figure out what is going on

174
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,000
before Jerry turns us into vegetables.

175
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,320
But how are we going to break
into Replatech?

176
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,640
That place has tighter security
than Fort Knox.

177
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,360
(helicopter whirrs)

178
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,680
I can get us in.

179
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,240
I mean, I think I saw
a secret entrance in the forest.

180
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,080
OK. It's worth a shot.

181
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,200
How are we going to get back
to the island?

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,840
The Heli-Jet is swarming
with WOOHP agents.

183
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
Leave it to me.

184
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,160
They must have slipped past us.
Pull our agents out.

185
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
(both gasp)

186
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,120
Where is my jet?

187
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,360
You don't think Jerry will miss this,
do you?

188
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, Clover, it looks like
you chipped your nail.

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Must have happened
when the warehouse collapsed.

190
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,760
ALEX: What exactly are we looking for?

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,720
I know I spotted some sort of hidden
entrance around here somewhere.

192
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,400
I don't know how you could've spotted
anything in this dense forest.

193
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
(all scream)

194
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,040
OK, so I guess you were right
about the secret entrance.

195
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,840
Hey, wait a second.

196
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,080
You said you wouldn't be caught dead
wearing cheesy sea foam nail polish.

197
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,080
That's ridiculous.
I love sea foam nail polish!

198
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,000
Love it! Sea foam! Sea foam!

199
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Sea foam! Love it! Sea foam!

200
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,600
OK, take it easy. I like sea foam too.

201
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,160
(gasps) What the...?
Let me go, you phony!

202
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,640
Who... What are you?

203
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
MAN: Impressive, aren't they?
I made them myself.

204
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,880
Nurtured them since they were
little more than strands of DNA.

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,080
Incredible likeness, don't you think?

206
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,280
And to think that Clover was upset
when Mandy stole her look.

207
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,680
Now that's really stealing her look.

208
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,240
Wait a second. You look familiar.

209
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,280
(screams)

210
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,320
Macker the safecracker.

211
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,720
It took my hair a year to grow back
after that mission.

212
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,000
As you can see,
that fall took its toll on me.

213
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,240
After I escaped from prison, I created
those clones using DNA from your hair.

214
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,840
Now I will destroy your lives
the way you tried to destroy mine.

215
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
I will now use my army of clones

216
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,360
to rob the central bank in every country
in the world at the exact same moment.

217
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,040
Of course, everyone will think
you girls perpetrated the crimes.

218
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,320
Like you'll actually get away with that.

219
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,880
Watch me! To your planes, girls!

220
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,040
If you'll excuse me, I must get
to my command center in the Alps.

221
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Take them away.

222
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Clover, you're alive!

223
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,360
Yeah, me
and 100 cheap knock-off Clovers.

224
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,400
Did you see those things up there?

225
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,280
Totally. That's why we've got
to get out of here and stop Macker.

226
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,720
But how?

227
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,360
No!

228
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
Good thing I decided to go
with diamond tipped spurs after all.

229
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Let's get to the Alps
before it's too late.

230
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
SAM: There's Macker.

231
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
Looks like he's using the transmitter
to control the clones.

232
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,560
ALEX: How are we going to take out
the transmitter?

233
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,880
We'll have to figure something out fast.
It's already started.

234
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,200
Get into position, ladies.
It's almost time.

235
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,320
CLOVER: OK, so maybe you have our looks.
Let's see if you have our moves.

236
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
- Yay!
- (clones scream)

237
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,200
(screams) Ouch!

238
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Phew.

239
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
Now is the time, girls.

240
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
What's going on?

241
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,240
Why aren't you robbing the banks?

242
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,280
What do you think
you're doing to my beloved clones?

243
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Ow! Let go of my hair!

244
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,000
(sighs)

245
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,320
(helicopter whirrs)

246
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,920
JERRY: Girls! Girls, wait!

247
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,680
(both scream)

248
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
SAM: Get away from us, Jerry!

249
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,960
Girls, it's OK.

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,960
We realize that you were
only trying to clear your names.

251
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,960
Oh, I guess we're lucky you figured
it out before you gave us lobotomies.

252
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,800
I hope you girls will accept
my sincerest apology.

253
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,720
ALL: Apology?

254
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,640
You'll be collecting your pension by the
time you're done making this up to us.

255
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,320
Snowball! Girls, please, sorry!

256
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,520
Now that we've taken care
of those clones,

257
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,600
it's time to win back Billy Bob and
expose Mandy for the thief that she is.

258
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,640
"Thief?"
Don't you think that's kind of harsh?

259
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,120
Well, that's what she is.

260
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
But she won't have a chance
to steal this new outfit.

261
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Um, I don't know how to break this
to you, Clover, but...

262
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,160
Oh, poo! That must be
where I got my design ideas.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
I guess Mandy's not a thief after all.

264
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,400
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I think I owe her an apology.

265
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,840
You thief!

266
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
- Billy Bob?
- Oh, hey, girls.

267
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,840
I'd like you to meet my new steady gal,
Alpha. Isn't she so original?

268
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,720
Steady gal? But Billy Bob,
I just designed this new outfit for you.

269
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Oh, well, honestly, I never really liked
that whole cowgirl look.

270
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,160
That's why I left Texas.

271
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,440
- This is so your fault!
- You need to hire a new stylist.

272
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,680
(both argue at once)
