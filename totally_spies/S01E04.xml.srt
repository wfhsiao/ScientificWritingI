<i>Diary entry: Thursday, 08.00 hours.</i>

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm baffled.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,640
Every vulcanologist
considers this a dormant volcano.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,000
But if that's true, then why...?

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,920
(gasps) What on earth...?!

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,920
What on earth...?!

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
{\an8}(school bell)

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,960
(screaming)

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,440
(all grunt)

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh, that was, like, the perfect end
to our harshest mission yet.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,760
For sure! After what we've been through,
school will be a breeze.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,520
{\an8}ALEX: Good thing tomorrow night
is the big dance!

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
{\an8}I so need to unwind!

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,120
{\an8}MANDY: Don't kick back yet, girls.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,800
This afternoon is the track meet
and having you three on our team...

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,080
..makes me glad I'm not.

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,680
(gasps) The track meet! We forgot!

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
(screams)

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,640
(yells)

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,120
(gasps)

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
(Alex screams)

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
{\an8}ALEX: Oh, I hope I can move by tomorrow,

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,480
and I hope the dance will help us
forget the way we blew the track meet!

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,200
Oh, don't say "dance" Alex.
It makes my feet hurt more.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,920
- SAM: Let's just relax.
- CLOVER: Yeah...relax...

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,880
(sighs)

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
(all scream)

37
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,320
(surprised grunts)

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Well, so glad you could drop in, ladies.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,880
Like we had a choice?

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
Jerry, tell me you're kidding.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
I mean, we just got back from
the most intense mission we ever had.

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,600
We are wiped! Trashed! Tweaked!

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,720
Relax.

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
ALEX: How, when you're about
to send us on another mission?

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,160
A mission to relax.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,440
You're no asset to WOOHP
when you're stressed,

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
so I'm sending you on vacation, here.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,520
- GIRLS: Oh!
- Let me guess.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,120
This is a bullet-proof covering we use
for escaping from a jungle prison?

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
No, this is a towel you use
for drying off after a swim.

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,880
Ah-ha, I bet this is a high-speed drill

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,000
and a tube of blasting gel
to blow out a wall!

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,880
No, a beach umbrella and sunscreen
to stop a sunburn.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,640
And before you ask,
that's a nose clip for swimming.

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
Oh, that's the Gadget Emergency Kit.
A precaution. You won't need it.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,760
Let me get this straight...

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,400
You're sending us somewhere to have fun?

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,720
JERRY: How does Hawaii sound?

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,480
Too good to be true.

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
I have just one question...
When does our flight leave?

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,760
In one minute. Just step in here.

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,360
This elevator's kinda small.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,240
Does it take us right to our plane?

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,200
Oh, there's no plane.
A cruise missile is much faster.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Bon voyage, ladies!

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,000
Huh?

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,080
GIRLS: Jerry! I never fly by missile!
I'm totally claustrophobed!

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,280
(all scream)

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
(all yell)

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
(all grunt)

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Hi! I'm Julie, your WOOHP travel agent!

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,920
You must be Sam, Clover and Alex.
I have your vacation all set!

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,080
Julie, could you be not quite so perky?

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
Huh?

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,400
I can't believe it,
we're really in Hawaii!

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,760
This is like my ultimate fantasy trip!

77
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,000
Up the beach, we have hula dancing!

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,240
If it'll get you to dial down
the perkiness, I'm there.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
My kind of dance is the Taualunga.

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Or you could just lie back
and work on your tan!

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,080
Now that's my kind of work.

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,240
(sighs)

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,840
I want action!

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,960
Like tomorrow night when we rock out
to the finest band in Beverly Hills...

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
Ultra Loud Zone!

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
(shrieks)

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,680
Whoops! My board got away from me.

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,040
My name's Alex. Who are you?

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,560
Corey, I came here to study volcanoes
with my college professor,

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,000
which is totally cool cos Hawaii
is my ultimate fantasy trip.

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,160
Really? Mine, too!

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Excellent!

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,760
Yeah, I love the food,
the people, the music...

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,600
- Though I'm not much at hula dancing.
- No?

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, my favorite dance is one
you might never have heard of.

96
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,800
It's called the Taualunga.

97
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,960
Mine too! This is almost, like, destiny!

98
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,560
- Who's your favorite band?
- Oh, wow, that's tough.

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,960
There's thousands to choose from but
I'd have to say my favorite is Ultra...

100
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
BOTH: Loud Zone!

101
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,480
(thump)

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,680
Are you doing anything later?

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,280
No, Professor Payley
was supposed to bring me

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,800
to his camp at that dormant volcano,
but he never showed.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Hey, wanna catch a wave?

106
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,080
Oh, sure!
Hey, surfin' is the only life for me.

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,200
(gasps)

108
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,600
Right. I just gotta go
tell my friend where I'll be.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,400
Clover, have you got a minute?
I need you to tell me how to surf.

110
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,600
Huh?

111
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,240
Corey, how big do these waves get?

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Oh, three. Maybe four.

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,080
- Feet?
- Stories.

114
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,400
Four stories?!

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,360
Here we go!

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,360
(Alex screams)

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Awesome! C'mon, Alex!

118
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Corey, I have a confession!

119
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,120
I never surfed anything bigger
than, uh, a 35-foot wave!

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,760
OK, hold on, Alex!

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,520
Corey!

122
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,000
ALEX: Sam! Clover! Help!

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Clover, give me a hand!

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,520
Get me out of here!

125
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
We're coming, Alex!

126
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,600
Get in!

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,240
(all scream)

128
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,680
- Anyone injured?
- I have critical split-end damage.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
And Corey's gone!

130
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,400
He stood right there and
vanished in a burst of fire.

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,720
It was like a volcano erupting!

132
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,480
This doesn't look like sand to me.

133
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,640
- It's obsidian, volcanic glass!
- Is there anything you don't know?

134
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Corey said his professor flaked out

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,720
and never showed for his field trip
to study that volcano!

136
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,720
There's a connection
between the missing volcano prof

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,280
and Corey going up in smoke?

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,920
I got a bad feeling about this.
I'm calling Jerry.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Jerry, this Sam. Hello? Hello?

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,120
<i>Hello, Sam. Are you there?</i>

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,520
<i>I don't read you, sorry.</i>

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,880
Forget it, your com-powder got wet.
We'll try ours.

143
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Maybe there's something
in the kit we can use.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,280
"Computer Spy Manual."

145
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,320
ALEX: Type in "volcano."
Let's see what comes up.

146
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,640
WOOHP has a Volcano
Research Lab in Iceland.

147
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Maybe they can answer our questions.

148
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,360
Iceland? Where it's like, all icy?

149
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,320
So? Corey needs our help!

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,520
Alex is right, Clover.
We have a duty to check this out.

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Hi!

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,040
Julie, we have to get to Iceland.

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,160
Oh, no problem! I'll arrange it!

154
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,800
I swear, if she doesn't stop grinning...

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,600
(girls gasp)

156
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,320
Not again!

157
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,840
ALEX: Can somebody
please scratch my neck?

158
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
CLOVER: Ow! Get your toe out of my eye!

159
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,280
(all scream)

160
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,640
(groans) This is so cold!

161
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,560
What are you doing in Iceland
dressed like this?

162
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,480
C-could we d-discuss this over
a hot, grande, d-decaf soy latte?

163
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,680
SAM: Dr Sorenson, we need to know
if you've had any reports

164
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
of volcanic eruptions in Hawaii.

165
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
SORENSON: We had one yesterday
and one earlier today.

166
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,800
Both were near a dormant volcano,
so we assumed they were false alarms.

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
If there were eruptions,

168
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,200
we'd have heard from our vulcanologist,
Professor Payley.

169
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
GIRLS: Professor Payley?

170
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,000
He's been missing since yesterday,

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,760
and his mega-cute student Corey
vanished earlier today!

172
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,920
(alarm)

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,080
Now I know we have a bug in the system.

174
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,560
(beeping)

175
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,600
You sure the eruptions aren't real?

176
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,040
My dear, if all these volcanoes
were to erupt at once,

177
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,760
it would mean massive
global destruction.

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,760
So, it's safe to go back to Hawaii?

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,960
Well, if people are disappearing there,
I wouldn't call it safe.

180
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
You're not thinking of going back?

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
(groans)

182
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,920
How did they get these things
in the kit?

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
Pass me the binocular shades.

184
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,800
I don't see any sign of Payley.
Can we just go home now?

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,400
Wait a sec, I see something down there.

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
SAM: Looks like glass!

187
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Whoa!

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,960
Watch your step.

189
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,000
(sighs) Clover, I owe you big-time.

190
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,440
You guys OK down there?

191
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
(gasps)

192
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,680
Whoa! Didn't think you'd
pay me back so soon.

193
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,520
Forget the he-went-home theory.
He wouldn't leave these.

194
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,480
Look, a camcorder!

195
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,440
Hey, let's make a video of us!

196
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,240
Don't! It may have recorded a clue!
Let's rewind and see what he was doing.

197
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
<i>What on earth...?!</i>

198
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,800
There was an eruption!

199
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,560
And Prof. Payley vanished
just like Corey!

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
One problem, Alex.

201
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
If this was all molten lava yesterday,

202
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,760
how come the rocks look
totally the same today?

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,080
Let me see. Alex, walk out there.

204
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
Is this where he was standing?

205
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,320
Exactly. See this crack?

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Duh! It's so obvious this is a trap...

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,360
(all scream)

208
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,080
(groans)

209
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,760
Corey! You're all right!

210
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,240
Alex, get out of here before
they catch you like they did us!

211
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
HENCHMAN: Intruders!

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
ALEX: I'll be back for you, Corey!

213
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,800
(girls gasp)

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,520
We just hit Volcano Central!

215
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
ALEX: It looks like that humongous laser
keeps the lava cooking!

216
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
I bet this place is wired into
every other volcano on earth!

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,280
What kind of freak came up with this?

218
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,840
That would be me!

219
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040
(all gasp)

220
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Dr Hefestus is the name,
global devastation is my game.

221
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Forgive me if I startled you.

222
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,240
Meeting people is so awkward.
Let's try this again, from the TOP!

223
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,240
Stop them!

224
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
Ow, my foot!

225
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,800
Don't mess...with our...vacation!

226
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,240
Put that down before someone gets hurt.

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
Like you!

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,120
(grunts)

229
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
HEFESTUS: Uh-uh-uh! Careful, girls.

230
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Volcanic fire ruined my face.

231
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,640
As it will... yours.

232
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
My machine can erupt
every volcano on earth!

233
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
(beeping)

234
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,920
And when the world is covered in lava,
you all will look like me!

235
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
(evil laughter)

236
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,480
You have serious issues, though I'm sure
it's nothing a facial wouldn't cure.

237
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,160
I can relate. That week I had a pimple,
I was a major witch.

238
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
True, but we still loved you anyway.

239
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,240
Your evil plan won't succeed, Hefestus.
Not if we have anything to say about it!

240
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,160
(evil laughter)

241
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,000
{\an8}ALEX: I guess we don't have
anything to say about it.

242
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,080
We're almost in the lava
and this heat is trashing my hair!

243
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Heat? Maybe my com-powder is dry!

244
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Jerry! Jerry?

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
Ah, forget it.

246
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,560
Sam calling Dr Sorenson!

247
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,200
Sam! Are you all right?

248
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,480
Well, we're kinda hung up, DrS.
Can you reach Jerry?

249
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
I'm a little busy myself!

250
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,360
Every volcano on earth
is starting to blow!

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,720
ALEX: We have to do something!
Molten lava's about to cover the world!

252
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,760
Not to mention our hair!

253
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,440
Alex, give me your nose-clip!

254
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
You go, cowgirl!

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,280
(whirring)

256
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Seize them!

257
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,080
I knew he'd say that. Split up!

258
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,960
(shrieks)

259
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,800
(gasps)

260
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,920
(shocked cries)

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
(yells)

262
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,400
Now, tell me where the keys are
so I can let my friends out!

263
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
I got your keys right here.

264
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
Hey!

265
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
Help us trash that volcano machine!

266
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,640
- We have to turn this off now!
- Yeah.

267
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,360
(crackling)

268
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
The lava's almost to our level!

269
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,000
Hot-foot alert!

270
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,360
Hey! (sniffs)

271
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
- I smell garlic.
- Huh?

272
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,440
This is hot, as in spicy.

273
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
It's definitely not lava.

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,840
- It's marinara sauce!
- HEFESTUS: That's right, ladies.

275
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,000
CLOVER: Hefestus!

276
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,880
There is no Hefestus.

277
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
GIRLS: Jerry?!

278
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,280
SAM: And your henchmen
are really WOOHP agents?

279
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,080
And Corey is really...?

280
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
Goofy!

281
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,760
You're not trying to destroy the world?
What's going on?

282
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,440
<i>It was all part of the test.</i>

283
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,960
- Everything was fake?
- Yes.

284
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,840
This phony volcano was once
an arch-villain's hideout.

285
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,400
Now I use it for our annual field test.

286
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
- You were testing us?
- Did we pass?

287
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
Uh, no.

288
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,360
The lava got you
before you could save the world.

289
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,200
So, you all have to undergo re-training.

290
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,680
Corey, you were in on this?

291
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,880
M-my name's Morey, n-not Corey.

292
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
So your favorite dance
isn't the Taualunga?

293
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,080
Sorry. Your beach bag was bugged.
I don't even dance.

294
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
(rumbling)

295
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
What is this, Jerry, extra credit?

296
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
No! This is real!

297
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,560
Great. We blow the track meet,
I fall for a dork, and now this!

298
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,400
<i>There is an actual volcano under</i>
<i>your fake one and it's erupting!</i>

299
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,920
(screams)

300
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,920
(shrieks)

301
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,320
They'll never be able to move all
that stone in time! We're trapped!

302
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Get back! That's real lava!

303
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,560
This is too ironic!

304
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
Look out!

305
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
If only we could fly through there!

306
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,880
That's it! Alex, your parachute's
back in the Emergency Kit, right?

307
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
Yeah, but what can we do with it?

308
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
Make a hot-air balloon, if we can
stretch the chute across the crack.

309
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,800
Leave it to me!

310
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
Everybody, hold on tight!

311
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
(explosion)

312
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,240
We made it, thanks to you girls.
You showed real resourcefulness!

313
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
You still going to flunk us?

314
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
JERRY: No, you pass, with flying colors!

315
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,320
CLOVER: Cool!
Now, how about a real vacation?

316
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
I've heard of guys being two-faced,
but Morey was ridiculous.

317
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,320
Let's forget Hawaii
and just enjoy the dance.

318
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
I wonder what theme they picked.

319
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,200
(cheering)

320
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,200
