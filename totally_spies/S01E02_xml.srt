(whoosh) (to move along quickly, making a soft sound like the wind)

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,840
(screams)

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,600
Tassara!

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,560
I've got you!

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
(grunts) (to make a short, low sound instead of speaking, usually because of anger or pain)

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,120
(horse whinnies) ((of a horse) to make a soft, high sound)

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
(hooves thundering) (the hard part on the bottom of the feet of animals such as horses, sheep, and deer)

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
{\an8}I'm telling you, girls,
with my new digital video camera,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,680
{\an8}I'm a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen!

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,720
{\an8}<i>Vote Clover for Queen!</i>
<i>I swear I won't be mean!</i>

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,600
Brilliant, isn't it?

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,320
It's, erm... great, Clover.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,920
Yeah. In a painfully honest kind of way.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,520
(band plays march)

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
Out of my way, ladies!

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400
(grunts)

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,680
<i>Clover is so over!</i>

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>It's Mandy who's dandy!</i> (dandy: very good. This is often said as a joke when really something is not good or you are not happy about it)

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,400
<i>Vote Mandy for Homecoming Queen! Yeah!</i>

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,000
(cheering and applause)

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,600
Ah, cheer up, Clover. You did your best.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,280
Besides, it's not like you had a chance
at becoming Homecoming Queen,

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,360
especially since I've got the entire
football team in my back pocket.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,640
- JV or Varsity?
- Both.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,480
Wow. Impressive.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
I think so.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
So, why don't you just
give up now, Clover,

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,560
and save yourself the humiliation

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,200
of losing to me in front of
the entire school?

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,720
(screams)

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,200
Looks like you'll need to do some
serious campaigning to beat Mandy.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
Are you kidding?
I can beat Mandy on my worst-hair day!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,960
Listen, Clover, I overheard everything (overheard: to hear what other people are saying without intending to and without their knowledge)

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,240
and I think I can help you
with your campaign.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,400
Heck, I might even be able to secure
the "nerd" vote for you.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,120
- There's more of us than you think.
- Thanks, but no thanks, brainiac.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,480
I do my own campaigning.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,520
Come on, girls,
you gotta help me campaign.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,320
- (whirring)
- ALL: Huh?

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
(all yell)

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Hmm.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,520
(all scream)

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,760
(screaming continues)

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,880
Ew! Jerry's really
crossed the line this time!

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,040
I hope he knows a good dry-cleaner! Ah!

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
(all yell)

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,320
If this means Jerry's
offering us a surprise cruise,

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm willing to forgive him
for ruining our clothes.

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,720
No such luck, ladies.

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Right now, you are en route to
the Northern African nation of Lyrobia

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,880
where there's been a rather
unusual kidnapping attempt

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
on the nation's Queen Tassara.

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,160
We suspect it was perpetrated
by the neighboring nation of Kenyopia.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
The countries have been at war
for 20 years.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you mean by
"unusual kidnapping attempt?"

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,000
Apparently, the perpetrator used
some sort of anti-gravity device

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,120
to literally lift the Queen
from her palace.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,320
- Cool!
- (snarls)

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,160
I mean, that's terrible. Just terrible.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Precisely why I'm sending you
to protect Her Majesty.

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
We don't want the conflict to escalate
and spill over into other nations.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Great, how am I supposed to campaign
when I'm stuck in Africa?

72
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,800
And now for the gadgets,
today you'll be receiving,

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
Heat Sensor 6,000 Infrared
Motion-Detector Sunglasses,

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,360
Compressed Water Capsules
for proper desert hydration,

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,240
High-Sensitivity
Electromagnetic Bracelets...

76
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Whoa!

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
(chuckles)

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Powerful little gadget.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,840
And, last but not least,
keys to a brand-new RATVAT.

80
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,160
A brand-new rat what?

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,480
A RATVAT.
Rugged All-Terrain Vehicle and Tunneler.

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
It'll be waiting when you
arrive at the palace.

83
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,240
And don't ding it,
we just had it painted.

84
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,760
And how do we get to the palace?

85
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
(all scream)

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Ta-ta!

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,920
{\an8}This map is completely useless.
It's just sand, sand and more sand.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,640
Well, we better get to civilization soon

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
cos this heat is totally
drying out my skin.

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,360
I need a mud-mask ASAP!

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,320
It's official, this country is
completely miserable and so am I.

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,320
I can kiss my dreams of becoming
Homecoming Queen goodbye!

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,360
Too bad you didn't have
someone back home

94
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,360
who could do your campaigning for you.

95
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,480
That's it!

96
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,120
What's it?

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,160
Arnold. It's Clover.
You know, your best friend.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm out of town and I was wondering

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,960
if your offer to help me with
my campaign still stands.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,960
- Of course, Clover.
- You will? That's great!

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,680
When monkeys fly!
You mean, mean, mean person!

102
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,000
C'mon, Arnold! It wasn't my fault.

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,480
I ate some bad sushi
that made me act that way.

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
OK. I'll help you...

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,080
- On one condition.
- Anything, Arnold. Just name it.

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,680
When you get back, you have to be
my girlfriend for one full week.

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,400
What?!

108
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,120
Ooh... How about a nice
lunch date instead?

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,800
- No way.
- Fine. I'll do it.

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
But only for one day and only if I win.

111
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,920
Don't worry, you'll win. I'm sure of it.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Things are suddenly looking up.

113
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,880
I say it's high time we call Jerry
and ask for real directions

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
and get out of this desert!

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Or, we could just ask someone
at that nice house over there.

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,200
SAM: That's not a house. It's the...

117
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
ALL: Palace!

118
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,640
SAM: You guys, be on your best behavior.

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Remember,
we're dealing with a real Queen.

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Welcome to Lyrobia.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm Queen Tassara
and this is my sister Makeda.

122
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,720
I assume you've been briefed
about the kidnapping attempt.

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,080
Totally! I'm mean... Indeed.
Jerry told us all about it.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,000
Sounds positively frightening,
Your Honor.

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,000
Especially considering
the King of Kenyopia and I

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
are to attend a peace conference in
Geneva to sign a war-ending treaty.

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,040
The fate of our nations
depends on my safety.

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Well, the best way to keep
her Excellency safe is to keep her,

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,600
I mean, you, out of sight.

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,720
True, unfortunately, the palace
is having a celebratory party tonight

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
and I'm obligated to attend.

132
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
Well, in that case,
we better come up with a plan.

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,400
Excuse me, but I need to consult with
Makeda about this evening's festivities.

134
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh... No problem.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Excuse us, Your Majesty.

136
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
I can't tell you how grateful
our people are to have your protection.

137
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Thank you, would you be
so kind as to show us

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,480
where the kidnapping attempt occurred?

139
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,080
Well, besides the solid gold bed,
nothing looks out of the ordinary to me.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Except for the floor.
It's totally dirty.

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,160
I mean, no offense, Your Highness.

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
This is where I landed when Akim
saved me from the anti-gravity ray.

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,880
Hmm. I'll send a sample to Jerry
for analysis right away.

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
Now, about tonight's party,

145
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
I was thinking one of us
should pose as Tassara

146
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,880
while the other two pose as servants
and thwart any kidnapping attempts.

147
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,360
- What do you think?
- It's a great idea, Sammy!

148
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Of course, I'll play the role of Queen.

149
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,760
Now that I get to be a real Queen,
a fake real one at least,

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,600
I could care less about being a dumb,
high-school Homecoming Queen!

151
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
I wonder what my first
Queenly duty should be?

152
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh, I know!

153
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,120
I'll go on a royal shopping spree.

154
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,640
Uh, Clover, why don't you let Tassara
decide what your "duties" should be?

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,680
(guests chatter)

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Man, I thought being the Queen
was supposed to be fun. This reeks!

157
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Is there anything I can do for you,
Your Majesty?

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,200
Yes, you can save me from this
totally lame receiving line

159
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
and help me cut a royal rug!

160
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,000
Duh! I want you to dance with me.

161
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
Very amusing, Queen Tassara.

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,960
You know that it is your duty
to stay in the royal receiving line.

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,840
But you have to let me dance!
I command you!

164
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,800
AKIM AND CLOVER: Makeda!

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Makeda. Makeda, are you OK?

166
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I guess all of the evening's excitement
must have gotten to me.

167
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,320
Perhaps you ought to go lie down.

168
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,240
Good idea.

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,960
That was quite nerve-wracking.

170
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,880
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
Everything's going to be fine.

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,600
(shocked cries)

172
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,120
Could be the kidnappers!
We better investigate!

173
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Hide behind here, Your Majesty!

174
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,160
(sniffs) I don't see anything,
but I definitely smell something!

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
(crackling)

176
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
Ooopsie.

177
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
Guess this wasn't the best place
to recharge my compowder.

178
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,920
Well, at least it's just a blown fuse
and not the kidnappers.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,520
(screaming)

180
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,480
(screaming continues)

181
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,920
(guests shout)

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,280
- Stop!
- Let her go!

183
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,560
(chuckles)

184
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,640
CLOVER: Help me!

185
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,120
(grunts)

186
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,720
Whoa!

187
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,320
Oh!

188
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,560
(shouting in background)

189
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

190
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,960
Wish I could say the same for Clover.

191
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,600
Makeda has been kidnapped, too!
I went to check on her and she's gone!

192
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
(both gasp)

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,800
ALEX: Hmm. Whoa. Déjà vu.

194
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
Let's see if Jerry has
any info on this stuff.

195
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,320
<i>Good evening, ladies.</i>
<i>How's the mission going?</i>

196
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Oh, it's going great, Jer!
Lyrobia is way cool!

197
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,280
Except for the part where Clover and
the Queen's sister have been kidnapped.

198
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,400
<i>Oh, my!</i>

199
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,960
So, do you have any info
on the sample I sent you?

200
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
I think it might help us find them.

201
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
<i>Oh, yes actually, the residue.</i>

202
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,960
<i>Apparently, it's some kind of</i>
<i>magnetic compound</i>

203
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,000
<i>found only on asteroids in outer space.</i>

204
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,960
Asteroids? That's strange.

205
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,280
And sad.

206
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,920
I mean, just think of poor Clover.
She hates outer space.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
She got a "D" in astronomy class.

208
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,440
I wonder if this has anything to do
with the asteroid crater

209
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
in the Northern part of Lyrobia.

210
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
We'll find out when we get there.

211
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,920
- C'mon, Alex!
- Wait. What about Queen Tassara?

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm coming with you.

213
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
I've got to find Makeda.
I feel responsible.

214
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,080
I don't know... It might not be safe.

215
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
- Well, it isn't exactly safe here.
- Good point.

216
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,800
(sighs) You know,
the desert's not all that bad

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,480
when you don't have to cross it
on a stinky old camel.

218
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
(beeping)

219
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Forget what I said, the desert sucks
no matter how you cross it!

220
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,280
Get ready to dive!

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, cool.

222
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
(squeals)

223
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,520
Pfft! Is this any way to treat a queen?

224
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,760
Hmm...

225
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,760
That's not the Queen, you fools!
You've got the wrong girl!

226
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Now go find Queen Tassara
and bring her to me immediately!

227
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,080
What should we do with this one?

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,880
She's useless to us.
Ship her to Siberia.

229
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,720
(loud crash / birds squawk)

230
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
TASSARA: This is it.

231
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
Talk about a change of scenery.

232
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,840
If there's any activity around here,
we should be able to find it with these.

233
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,560
I see something across the crater!
It's coming this way!

234
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,080
Maybe it's the kidnappers!

235
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't see anything.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
(growls)

237
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,640
(roars)

238
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,320
(all scream)

239
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,040
(screaming continues)

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,880
I guess you finally got
the mud mask you wanted.

241
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Look!

242
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,360
ALEX: This must be it.

243
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,240
I mean, it practically screams
"bad-guy hideout".

244
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,080
This looks like the dust
we found in Tassara's room.

245
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
Let's check it out.

246
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,960
Call off the search.

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,880
The foolish girls have been nice enough
to deliver the Queen to our front door.

248
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,000
Maybe I was wrong.

249
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,960
It doesn't look like anyone's
been in here for a hundred years.

250
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,960
Hey! Clover!

251
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,520
Have you seen Makeda?

252
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm fine, thank you for asking!
And no, I haven't seen Makeda.

253
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,160
I haven't seen anything
but the inside of this crate!

254
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,160
MAKEDA: I'm right here.

255
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
Oh! Makeda! You're OK?

256
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,600
Yes. Unfortunately,
I can't say the same for you four.

257
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
What's this?

258
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
(all scream)

259
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,440
TASSARA: What's happening!?

260
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,440
You're being kidnapped,
once and for all.

261
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,680
But why?

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,240
How else can I stop you from going
to Gevena and signing that treaty?

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
You see, if the war ends

264
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,640
I won't be able to sell my anti-gravity
guns to the General of Kenyopia.

265
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,280
I don't get it.
Why would you sell weapons to the enemy?

266
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
It's simple, really. I struck a deal.

267
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,960
When Kenyopia wins the war,
I'll be Queen of both countries!

268
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,280
In fact, I'm going to Lyrobia's
weapons factory right now

269
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
to finalize my deal with the General.

270
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Besides, it's time you passed the crown.

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
But what about us? You can't just
leave us floating here forever!

272
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,200
Don't worry, Sis.
You won't be floating for long.

273
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,400
This place is rigged to explode
in a matter of minutes.

274
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
So long, girls.

275
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,240
Great. Now what are we supposed to do?

276
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,840
- We've got to break the gravity field.
- And how are we supposed to do that?

277
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,240
The only devices we have left
are these dumb bracelets.

278
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
Which, might I add, are totally gaudy.

279
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,360
Alex, you are a genius!

280
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
I am? I mean... Yes, I am.

281
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,360
How am I a genius again?

282
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,960
Quick. Everybody turn your bracelets on!

283
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,920
(all grunt)

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
SAM: Anyone up for leaving?

285
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,920
(all scream)

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,480
Eurgh.

287
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,360
OK, my pores are
officially over-hydrated.

288
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,480
Stop messing around! We've got to get
to that weapons factory right away!

289
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
It's hidden in Mount Killilea.
I can take you there.

290
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
(roaring and screaming)

291
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
SAM: Quick! To the RATVAT!

292
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,960
(dog barks)

293
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,320
ALEX: There's the entrance,
just like Tassara said.

294
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
(alarm)

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
ALEX: What is this place?

296
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,600
SAM: This is where Makeda's scientists
build the anti-gravity guns.

297
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,640
Look. It's Makeda and the General.

298
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
(all gasp)

299
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,200
(grunts)

300
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,920
(yells) Guards!

301
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,520
(alarm)

302
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,000
(gunfire)

303
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,840
Look out!

304
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,320
(yells)

305
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
(screams)

306
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,000
What kind of an evil place is this?!

307
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,320
(gasps)

308
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
(screams)

309
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,320
(growls)

310
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
(screaming)

311
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
(laughs)

312
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
<i>(yells)</i>Oh...

313
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,240
Take that!

314
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't move or I'll blast you with...
with this lame radio thingy.

315
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
Oh, shoot.

316
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,920
Are you crazy? Put that down.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,120
- You'll destroy us all!
- Huh?

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,520
It's a highly-sensitive
"earthquake generator" you fool!

319
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Yeah, sure it is. Nice try, guys.

320
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
Huh?

321
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,680
(screaming)

322
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
Run!

323
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
(rumbling)

324
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,480
(panicked screams)

325
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,560
We've got to stop them.
They're getting away!

326
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,720
Not so fast.

327
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,400
No!

328
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Excellent work, girls.

329
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,040
CLOVER: No time for congratulations!

330
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,480
You have to get Tassara to the
Peace Conference in Geneva right away.

331
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,080
JERRY: Ohhh!

332
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,240
CLOVER: I'm so glad to finally be home.

333
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
I mean, is it me,
or was that the worst mission ever?

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,720
Worst mission ever?
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,440
Yeah, we just helped end a 20-year war!

336
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,360
Whatever. Being Queen was totally lame!

337
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,680
Hey, check it out!

338
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,040
I guess this means Arnold's been busy.

339
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Clover, you're back!

340
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
<i>Attention, students, the results</i>
<i>of the Homecoming race are in.</i>

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
<i>This year's Queen is none other than...</i>

342
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
<i>Clover!</i>

343
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
(all cheer)

344
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,240
I can't believe it. I lost!

345
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,440
Clover! Clover! Clover! Clover! Clover!

346
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,200
I can't believe it! I won!
Isn't it the greatest?

347
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,320
I thought you were over
the whole Queen thing.

348
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,640
Are you kidding?!
I can't wait to begin my reign.

349
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,320
And I promise to make
you two my servants...

350
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,160
Uh, I mean advisors.

351
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,040
Congratulations, Clover.

352
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,680
Say, what do you think about
me and you going steady?

353
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,200
(squeals)

354
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,960
I say, you've got yourself a de...

355
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,760
- Hold your horses, Clover.
- Huh?

356
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,040
Remember your promise?

357
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,040
You're my girlfriend.

358
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
At least for today.

359
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,600
Oh. Right...

360
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,840
Clover! Clover! Clover!

361
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,600
(chanting continues)

362
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,800
(cheering and applause)

363
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, well, every queen needs a king.
