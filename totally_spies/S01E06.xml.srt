(models scream)

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,000
{\an8}Clover, where are you taking us?

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,920
{\an8}SAM: Last time she did this we ended up
at the Body-Piercing Hut, remember?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,120
{\an8}That's right! It took us four hours

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,800
{\an8}to convince her that a lip ring
wouldn't "enhance her natural beauty."

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Relax, girls,
this surprise is totally piercing free.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,520
Now take off your blindfolds.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,080
Ta-da!

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,920
The Groovy Smoothie Shack?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,760
I don't get it, Clover.
Are you thirsty or something?

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,520
No. I'm here to sign up for the
Miss Groovy Smoothie beauty contest

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,480
- and you're here to support me.
- A food court beauty contest?

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,800
You're kidding, right? I mean,
you know beauty's only skin deep.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,280
Of course. I'm not kidding!
And, judging by the competition,

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,000
- I'd say I'm a shoe-in for victory.
- Um, not so fast, Clover.

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
This is my competition and mine alone.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Nothing or no-one is gonna stop me from
becoming Miss Groovy Smoothie

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,080
and launching my modeling career.
(laughs)

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,720
Cos everyone who's ever won this contest
has gone on to bigger and better things.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
And I intend to join them,
thank you very much.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
Now, why don't you and those cheap shoes
of yours just step off.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,800
The only thing that's cheap around
is here is your pathetic attempt

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,640
at trying to get me to back down.
Now outta my way!

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720
Come on, girls.
Let's go plan my victory party.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
(Mandy scoffs)
MANDY: As if!

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,600
Can you believe the nerve of that girl?

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Tell me about it. I mean, how dare she
accuse you of wearing cut-rate shoes!

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,320
I say we ditch the mall,
grab a mani/pedi,

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,000
- and forget all about boring old Mandy.
- BOTH: Deal!

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,680
(they scream)

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
(elevator dings)

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,240
(groans)

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,840
I don't remember the parking structure
being quite this dark.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,800
Uh, Alex, something tells me
we're not at the mall anymore.

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,720
(they scream)

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,720
- Hello, ladies.
- Jerry. Should have known.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Nice to see you too. Now, allow me
to brief you about your new mission.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
- So much for that mani/pedi.
- We've just been informed

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
that approximately a dozen models
from all over the world

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,120
have literally been stolen
within the last 24 hours.

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,440
- What do you mean "stolen?"
- We're currently en route to New York

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520
where you'll go undercover
as journalists at Fashion Week,

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,720
a hugely important industry event

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,760
where you'll have access to
everyone who's anyone.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,880
You want us to see what we
can find out about the abductions?

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,520
Precisely. And now for the gadgets.
This time you'll be utilizing

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,840
the magnetic spring-loaded
bungee belt in faux snakeskin,

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,320
the ultra-inflatable nylon tek vest,

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,560
a pair of hologram-projecting
mood rings,

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,680
the titanium drill-heel boot
for impromptu tunneling,

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,920
and last, but not least,
the M-Ray contact lens in aquamarine.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,200
- "M-Ray?"
- For seeing through metal.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,640
Now, goodbye and good luck, spies.
I'll be in touch!

65
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,400
(they scream)

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
I've heard of fashion police,
but this is ridiculous.

67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,320
Must be because of the abductions.

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,680
Man, talk about a mob scene!

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,840
Everyone's here to see the new modeling
phenom, Gazelle.

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
- Gazelle?
- She arrived on the scene overnight.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
The witch is already getting
all the available modeling work.

72
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Me and the rest of the supermodels
are pretty much out of luck.

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,480
I think we need a better view.

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,720
(crowd clamors)

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,720
CLOVER: I've never seen anyone so...
so perfect. It's unbelievable!

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,960
- Better keep an eye on her, Alex.
- Right.

77
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,400
- What's she doing?
- Taking off her gloves.

78
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,920
- ALEX: Hmm... now that's odd.
- What?

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,840
The skin on her arms and hands...
it's all sorts of different colors.

80
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,600
As in her tanning bed's on the fritz?

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,160
"Different colors" as in
the Bride of Frankenstein.

82
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Maybe she's not so perfect after all.

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,720
How about we go backstage
for a closer look?

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,320
Now remember, we're supposed to be
journalists so act professional.

85
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
CLOVER: Ew! Nast!

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,640
Not exactly the professional demeanor
I had in mind, Clover.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Hi, Gazelle. I'm Sam from
<i>Trend Of The Moment</i>magazine.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,520
I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoyed the show.

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,320
Thanks. But the truth is I owe
everything to my agency.

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,920
Really. I wouldn't exist without them.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,600
MAN: Yes,
and we wouldn't exist without her.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,640
I'm Helmet from Picture Perfect.
I represent Gazelle.

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,320
She's single-handedly
put our agency on the map.

94
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,920
- You're a modeling agent?
- That's right.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,880
So you'd know if I had
what it takes to be a model?

96
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
- (sighs)
- (groans)

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,400
My philosophy is that everyone has
something about them that's perfect.

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,360
In your case, it's your legs.

99
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,400
So, you're saying I'm model material?!

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Sorry. Not quite.

101
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,600
Come on, Gazelle.
You need your beauty rest.

102
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,520
Gazelle, wait! You dropped your...

103
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,800
(gasps) ...ear?

104
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,920
I've sent the ear to WOOHP for analysis.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,520
Our next move is to investigate
Picture Perfect.

106
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,880
Picture Perfect, please.

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,720
I mean, what kind of pathetic agency
are they, anyway?

108
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,520
Take that Helmet guy, for instance.
He calls himself an agent?

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,680
He wouldn't know a model
if she sashayed right into him!

110
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,120
Come again?

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,280
No matter what Helmet says,
I know I'm model material.

112
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
- (knocking)
- MAN: Special delivery.

113
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,040
It's from the Groovy Smoothie Shack.

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,720
It says I'm a finalist in the
Miss Groovy Smoothie beauty contest!

115
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,280
This proves it, I am model material!

116
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
(they sigh)

117
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,480
- Ouch!
- Are you OK?

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

119
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
We wouldn't want anything to happen
to our potential beauty queen.

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
(helicopter whirrs)

121
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,960
(screams)

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,760
Clover!

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,920
CLOVER: Hey!
You're stretching out my perfect legs!

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,480
ALEX: They're trying to shake us off!

125
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,040
(they scream)

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, that was a little too close
for comfort.

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,600
Speaking of comfort,
you wanna get me out of this thing?

128
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,040
CLOVER: Help me!

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,520
Quick. Look inside the helicopter
and see if there's any clues!

130
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,120
ALEX: The pilot has the Picture Perfect
logo on his jacket!

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,080
We'd better call Jerry.

132
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,240
<i>Hello, ladies. How's the Big Apple?</i>

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,880
Rotten, Jerry. Clover's been kidnapped.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,720
Oh, dear.
That's the second time this month.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,120
<i>What do you know about</i>
<i>the Picture Perfect Modeling Agency?</i>

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,240
JERRY:<i>Let's see... apparently it's run</i>
<i>by an ex-model named Tuesday Tate.</i>

137
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,760
<i>Their headquarters are in</i>
<i>Sydney, Australia.</i>

138
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,720
SAM: We're journalists from
<i>Trend Of The Moment.</i>

139
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,160
You aren't on Miss Tate's schedule.
You'll have to leave.

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Is it me or is there something
very familiar about that woman?

141
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
Not to mention something very rude.

142
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Looks like we're gonna have to enter
Picture Perfect the hard way.

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
SAM: Never underestimate
the power of a good accessory.

144
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,400
ALEX: Looks more like some kind of
high-tech clinic than a modeling agency.

145
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
(they gasp)

146
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,520
SAM: I wonder what's in here?

147
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,000
Hey, check that out!
Those are both Gazelle?

148
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,000
Man, talk about a split personality.

149
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,840
Jackpot! Gazelle's "donors."

150
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Stacey, Aimee, Anna, Kelley, Gretchen...

151
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,040
- (Compowder alert)
- Sam here.

152
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>I thought you'd be interested to know</i>

153
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,320
<i>that the ear you sent me belongs to</i>
<i>a model who was abducted last week.</i>

154
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
<i>Her name is Gretchen.</i>

155
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,240
(gasps) Sam, that's... that's one of
the names on the donor list!

156
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,120
<i>Donor list?</i>

157
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,320
I know what it seems like, Alex,
but how could it be possible?

158
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,440
(woman clears throat)
Can I help you, ladies?

159
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,120
Uh, yes. Yes, you can. We're journalists
from<i>Trend Of The Moment</i>and...

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,560
...and we're here to interview you!

161
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,920
OK. But you'll have to make it snappy.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm leaving soon for a model search
in New Zealand.

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,920
So... I hear that you used to be
a model, Miss Tate. Why did you quit?

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,520
I injured my leg at a photo shoot
two years ago.

165
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
It was a circus theme and
I was to play the role of lion tamer.

166
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
Unfortunately, the lion tamed me.
Now I have this.

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,920
Why don't you tell us about
Picture Perfect

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,800
and how it is that you've achieved
this sudden success?

169
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,000
- (telephone rings)
- Tuesday speaking.

170
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Oh, I see...

171
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,520
Would you ladies mind moving to
the waiting room down the hall

172
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
while I take this call?

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
- Not at all.
- No problem.

174
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
Those two are definitely trouble.

175
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,200
Well, then, we'd better eliminate them.

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,360
- (alarm blares)
- SPIES: Uh-oh.

177
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,920
I'd say our interview's
just been cut short!

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
We'd better find Clover
before it's too late.

179
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,280
Get them!

180
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,720
(growls)

181
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
We have to get to that restricted area
we found earlier.

182
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,640
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

183
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,600
(they scream)

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,520
- SAM: Clover!
- What happened to you?

185
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,240
Picture Perfect steals body parts!
That's how they created Gazelle!

186
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Right now there's someone else out there
running around with my perfect legs!

187
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
(they gasp)

188
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,280
Don't worry.
We're gonna get all of you out of here.

189
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,760
TATE: I wouldn't be so sure about that.
We can't just let you leave

190
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,720
and risk you telling the world
about our little secret.

191
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,600
- (they struggle)
- Why are you doing this?

192
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,720
It's simple, really. I want to create
an army of perfect models

193
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,440
so that I can dominate the industry
that destroyed my career.

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,320
Couldn't you just steal yourself
a new leg instead?

195
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I mean,
it seems like a lot less trouble.

196
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,320
You've got a point. But somehow my evil
revenge plan just sounds like more fun.

197
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,880
Well, it'll never work.

198
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,000
Perhaps you'll feel a little differently
after my demonstration, darling.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,360
Hey, those are my legs!

200
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,200
Correction. They were your legs.
Now they belong to Picture Perfect.

201
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,960
Just like your friends' body parts
are about to.

202
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,360
Prepare to be modelized.

203
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,120
(beeping)

204
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
(they shriek)

205
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,880
(gasps)

206
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
(they shriek)

207
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
And I thought I had it bad.

208
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,320
Now, since I'll be getting plenty of new
donors from all around the world

209
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,080
at the Auckland Convention Center,
I'm quite ready to dispose of you.

210
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
- Dispose of us?
- Yes.

211
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
We're gonna dump you in the ocean

212
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,120
where you'll join a school of ferocious,
man-eating sharks for lunch.

213
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
(they shriek)

214
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
I don't know about you girls, but I'm
not ready to be fish food quite yet.

215
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Me neither. Even if I do look
like a science experiment gone bad.

216
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,520
Trust me.
We'll be outta here in no time.

217
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,960
CLOVER: Fine. I'll trust you.
Just promise me you'll stop smiling.

218
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,480
Your braces are blinding me.

219
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,480
Nice goin', Sam. What's our next move?

220
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,320
Since we can't get into the cockpit,
I'll get the pilot to come to us.

221
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,640
Just be ready for him.

222
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,400
(yells)

223
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
- Good work, Red.
- Right back at ya.

224
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
Now all we have to do is get to
New Zealand and stop Tuesday.

225
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,040
SAM: That's a great idea,
except for one thing.

226
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,600
Now that you've knocked the pilot
unconscious, who'll fly the plane?

227
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,720
- (they gasp)
- OK, why am I doing this?

228
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,320
Because the pedals
are really hard to press

229
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,960
and you're the one with the...
stout, powerful legs.

230
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Right.

231
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,800
HELMET: Oh, that skin, it's magnificent.
We can definitely use you.

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,400
I'd say your toes are among
the loveliest specimens I've ever seen.

233
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,280
You're Picture Perfect material
for sure.

234
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,720
Now why don't you step inside the
Modelizer...

235
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,040
I mean, the photo booth...
so we can take some pictures of you?

236
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,000
That should be plenty.
In a matter of minutes

237
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,360
we'll have ourselves
an army of Picture Perfect models.

238
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,360
(they shriek)

239
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,040
- (airplane engine)
- What the...?

240
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,800
(they scream)

241
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
- SAM: Way to go, Clover!
- All in a day's work.

242
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Uh, guys... I think we've got trouble.

243
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
We've got to get them out of
the Modelizer

244
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,880
before they end up pieced together
like us!

245
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,160
It's locked!

246
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Don't worry.
I'll find Tuesday and her key.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
She's on the other side of
the convention center with Helmet!

248
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,840
Well, then, we'd better get moving.

249
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,360
ALEX: Gotcha!

250
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,280
Now hand over the key
to the modelizing machine!

251
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,080
You want the key? Go get it!

252
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,320
Great. This is gonna be like trying
to find a nail file in a haystack.

253
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
Well, you'd better hurry because once
the modelizing process is complete,

254
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,720
it'll be irreversible. Just a new
feature I've added to the machine.

255
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you doing?

256
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,480
Trying to locate the key with the
compowder fingerprint scanner.

257
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Bingo! Now let's get back to the girls!

258
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,320
What about these two?

259
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,000
JERRY: Don't worry.
We'll take care of them.

260
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,520
ALEX: So... you're sure about this?
You're definitely dropping out?

261
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,120
Absolutely. I've decided that
I've had enough modeling

262
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
and beauty contests for one lifetime.

263
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,400
The whole scene's just way too evil.
Besides, ever since I got my legs back,

264
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,720
I remember how gorgeous I truly am.
I don't need anyone else's validation.

265
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,320
I always knew you were
beautiful and smart.

266
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,520
JUDGE: Well, that's too bad
because you would have won.

267
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,320
But since you dropped out,

268
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
I'll be awarding the first runner up
your $25,000 cash

269
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,920
and your brand new convertible
sportscar. Congratulations, Mandy!

270
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,080
Thank you! Thank you one and all!

271
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,320
CLOVER: $25,000?
Wait, I was only kidding!

272
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,120
It was a joke!
I want to be Miss Groovy Smoothie!

273
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, well. So much for Clover
thinking the whole scene is evil.
