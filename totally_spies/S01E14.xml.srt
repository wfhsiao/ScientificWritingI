13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,240
{\an8}CLOVER: C'mon, Sammy,
why don't you blade with us?

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,160
{\an8}Yeah, it doesn't matter that
you're a lame rollerblader,

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
{\an8}you can still at least try to have fun.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,920
Ladies, and I quote, "Excess time
spent on recreational activities

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,760
could be better spent
exercising the mind."

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
(they yawn)

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,160
I got a quote for ya, "Go fish!"

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
(they laugh)

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
BOTH: Huh?

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,160
SECURITY GUARD:
Well, well. Look what we have here.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Skaters and violators.
You know the rules, girls.

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,600
No roller blading and no littering.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,040
Littering? I was making a wish
and ran out of pennies.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,080
Save it for someone who cares.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,080
Thankfully, a model citizen
alerted me to the situation.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,000
It's them, Mr. Officer! If you want, I
can identify each criminal in a line up.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
The only thing criminal here
is your nasty haircut and faux nails.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
You can't believe anything she says.
She's a notorious rumor spreader!

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
Believe me, sir,
I know these girls all too well.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,360
They are repeat offenders
and shouldn't be free to roam the mall!

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,320
Now, now. This poor young lady
was merely doing a good deed.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,480
Here.
Good for 20% off anything in the mall.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,920
I'll be back with reinforcements.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
Great. I didn't even do anything wrong.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh, that's right. You didn't do
anything, Miss... Miss Sam No Fun.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,680
- BOTH: Sam No Fun, Sam No Fun!
- Cut it out! Stop it! Right now!

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
(they scream)

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,040
Afternoon, ladies.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,880
CLOVER: Do you have a blow dryer
in your pocket, Jer?

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,720
JERRY: Sorry.
Only WOOHP terry cloth beach towels.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,240
You can take one home as a souvenir
after your mission.

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
- You'll have to teach me that sometime.
- Sure thing.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,320
Right after you get something to wrap.

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,480
We've uncovered something
quite bizarre and troubling.

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,840
It seems world leaders have been
creating dangerous thrill rides

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,720
- in their respective countries.
- BOTH: Thrill rides?!

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,760
In Germany, the Chancellor instructed

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
the removal of the lines on
the Autobahn. He also added ramps.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Driving has become a reckless,
road raging, bumper car speedway.

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,560
In Malaysia, the Prime Minister
has programmed

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,400
the elevators of the Petronas Towers
to drop 88 floors.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
(people scream)

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,120
Lastly, the Brazilian President ordered
cables cut on a suspended bridge.

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
Tourists were left dangling
above crocodile-infested waters.

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Why would world leaders
convert safe national landmarks

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,160
into major danger zones?!

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,600
Frankly, that's what we need you
to find out.

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,360
The Emperor of Japan's wife
is a former WOOHP agent.

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,000
Through her, you can get
access to her husband.

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Japan? That's like sushi central!
Let's go.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Uh, wait for the gadgets.
One Digit Decoder Card,

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,520
one can of
Insta-Freeze Back-off Breath Spray,

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,720
a Pocket-Sized Protracting LipSpear,
the Just Sticky Enough Glue Gloves,

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,080
the Mini-Lint Vac Battery De-Charger
and CATS.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Cats? I'm more of a dog person...

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,840
It stands for
Crystalline Airtight Trisect Shield.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,400
- As long as it's litter box trained.
- Yes. Very amusing.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
(they scream)

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,920
Hey, you guys think this bullet train
has a sushi bar on it?

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
(sniffs) Here fishy, fishy...

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,720
Let's just hope it takes us to
the Emperor's palace... soon!

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
I'd like to breathe again.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Can't you at least try to have fun, Sam?

76
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,880
Yeah. Where else can you experience
a nice smooth ride like this?

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,840
During an earthquake?

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
(they scream)

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,920
Since when do public trains do
loop de loops?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,960
Can we just get out of here
before I lose my sashimi?

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,120
This Digit Decoder Card
should do the trick.

82
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
(beeping)

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
I think we need a little more
purchasing power.

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Credit cards...
is there anything they can't do?

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,320
(they yell)

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,400
- Did we make it?
- I think so.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,720
Hey, there's the Emperor's palace!

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,520
ALL: Huh?

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
CLOVER: Who are the suits?

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,840
SAM: I think this isn't
the welcoming committee.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,920
You're making one super-sized mistake,
Mr. Scary Japanese Guard.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,200
I just learned a mean martial arts move
in gym class.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
Hold it! I'm Keiko, the Emperor's wife.
These are my guards.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
Oopsie.

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,960
What do you know? This is
the welcoming committee after all.

96
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,400
KEIKO: Jerry said you'd be coming.
Follow me.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,000
If you need anything, Mr. Katsu
will be happy to assist you.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,240
Sorry, Katsu. I never valet park
the designer originals.

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,080
- (they gasp)
- Hello, ladies.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,000
Hello, Mr. Emperor. Sir. Master of
Masters, Ruler of the Unruly...

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,160
Goodbye, ladies. Goodbye.

102
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,400
OK. A man of few words.

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Too few. I've got a feeling there's
something he's not telling us.

104
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,000
CLOVER: Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get to the bottom of this.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,640
CLOVER: A palace filled with neat stuff
and we're stuck in this bore-atorium.

106
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Uh-oh. Could be the Emperor.
Get out your Just Sticky Enough Gloves.

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
You're sure these gloves
are sticky enough?

108
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,760
- What's he doing with that battery?
- It looks like he's charging himself.

109
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,000
SAM: The repeated words, stiff hand
gestures, the battery charger...

110
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,560
- It's like he's some kind of animatron.
- Anima-what?

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Ah ha! Just as I suspected.
The gloves weren't sticky enough.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
Guards!

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
(they shriek)

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Girls! In here. Quick.

115
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,120
- What was that all about?
- I don't know how to say this,

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,880
but we think the Emperor has been
replaced by an animatron.

117
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,880
Oh, my. That would explain
the Emperor's bizarre behavior.

118
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
Someone must have abducted
the real Emperor.

119
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,800
You girls must find my husband.
He may be in great danger!

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,000
- We'll do everything we can.
- Whoever abducted the real Emperor

121
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,000
must be using a signal
to control the animatronic Emperor.

122
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,920
We just need a way to track the signal.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
Wait. I've got it.

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,880
- A compact?
- It's a gadget from my spy days.

125
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
That thing is anything but light.

126
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,280
KEIKO: A compact with a satellite dish.
A Compactellite.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,440
Regardless, it should track the signal.

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
(they yelp)

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,360
You can borrow the family jet.
It's very fast.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,360
(they yell)

131
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,800
- (growls)
- No, not the shoes!

132
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,320
- ALEX: We must be close.
- (beeping)

133
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,440
- Because the beeping is getting faster?
- No, I can't hold this thing anymore.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,880
At least there aren't any long lines.

135
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,040
SAM: Check out these footprints.

136
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
That's weird. The signal seems
to be coming from beneath us.

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,800
(wood splinters)

138
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,200
(they groan)

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,840
I never did like merry-go-rounds.

140
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,040
OK. So which way is out?

141
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,440
SAM: Not that way.

142
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,360
Oh! Hi. We were just leaving...

143
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,800
Sure you wouldn't rather just talk
this out instead? Didn't think so.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Back off, robot breath!

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,240
SAM: One, two... three!

146
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
ALL: Cool!

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,720
I've had it. There aren't any Emperors
down here. Just dirt and rats and...

148
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
- MAN: Get out of my face!
- MAN 2: Oh, be quiet, Mr. President.

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
- MAN 3: I was here first!
- ..irritable foreign men.

150
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,280
- Locked. There's got to be a way in.
- Hmm. Let me try something.

151
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,400
Now I get it. That martial arts move
was for taking out doors,

152
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,120
- not Japanese guards.
- Whoa.

153
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,440
There's got to be every leader
in the world.

154
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, no. More bad guys.

155
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Relax. We're the good spies.
I've always wanted to say that.

156
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,960
You'd better untie us quickly
before that doctor finishes his plan

157
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,840
and makes us all disappear.

158
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,840
VOICE:<i> Sorry, girls,</i>
<i>but the park is closed.</i>

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
Hello, intruders.

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,120
Welcome to my once secret laboratory.
I am Dr. Eisenstein.

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
- Dr. Eisenstein?
- Yes, I know.

162
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,320
With a name like Eisenstein,
I knew I'd either have to be a genius

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,600
or create a monster.
I decided to do both.

164
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,720
So, Doc. Why replace all the
world's leaders with your robots?

165
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,480
- To show off your hidden talent?
- Hardly.

166
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,720
I've been making animatrons
since you were a little girl

167
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,520
going to amusement parks
just to have fun.

168
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,920
You mean Sam used to have fun?

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
BOTH: Sam No Fun, Sam No Fun,
Sam No Fun...

170
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,920
My animatrons were the best!
Then came this new invention...

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Video games!

172
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,480
Now children would rather
move around a plastic joystick

173
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,760
than see a life-like
swashbuckling pirate!

174
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,320
So, you thought you'd get back in
the biz by kidnapping world leaders

175
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,680
and replacing them with
your machine men?

176
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,520
No, I decided to get revenge by making
my version of the greatest rulers

177
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
and programming them to build
hazardous thrill rides.

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,520
The world will be
my personal amusement park

179
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,240
until it inevitably destroys itself!

180
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,520
- OK, this guy puts the "reek" in freak.
- Yeah, that plan stinks

181
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,800
even more than your average
evil-doctor-takes-over-the-world plan.

182
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Look at me.
I've been having all the fun so far.

183
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,720
Don't worry, girls,
I promise to make it up to you

184
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,200
by letting you try
my favorite ride in the park.

185
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,720
DR. EISENSTEIN: Now, allow me
to explain how the ride works.

186
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,560
When the car you're in gets up to
15 rotations, the ride will blow up.

187
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,280
In other words, after the explosion,

188
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,120
my cotton candy will have
more of a form than you girls.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,920
Oh, and remember to keep your hands and
feet inside the vehicle at all times.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You wouldn't want to get hurt. (laughs)

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
Sarcastic much?!

192
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,920
ALEX: We're at the fifth rotation
already.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,320
SAM: Don't worry, I'm sure we'll figure
a way out of this. Soon.

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,520
Any second now... The LipSpear!
If I could only reach it...

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,240
- ALEX: Thirteenth rotation...
- Got it!

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,880
Fourteenth!

197
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,120
Oops. Guess we forgot to keep
our hands and feet

198
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
inside the vehicle at all times.

199
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
ALEX: Where'd all the world leaders go?

200
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,320
Load 'em up, boys. This trailer's
already late for a date.

201
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,760
Off a bridge, that is. Now,
which robot did I program to drive?

202
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Driving them into the river?
Like, how "mysterious" is that?

203
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
SAM: We've got to catch that trailer.

204
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,400
- But how?
- (truck horn)

205
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,760
CLOVER: Shotgun.

206
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,680
They're getting away! Don't we have a
gadget we can use to catch up to them?

207
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
Gadget?
We don't need no stinkin' gadget.

208
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,120
CLOVER: Are you sure
this is such a good idea?

209
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,680
No!

210
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
(shrieks)

211
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,160
- How does this thing work?
- Like this.

212
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,680
BOTH: We did it!

213
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,520
(world leaders thank them)

214
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,240
What's with world leaders
and their drab gray suits?

215
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Would it kill them to throw
some white into their wardrobes?

216
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,520
Don't worry, we're going to return
you all to your countries.

217
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,160
All we have to do is return the leaders
and deactivate the animatrons

218
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,200
before Eisenstein realizes
he's lost his trailer...

219
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,520
SAM: First stop, Malaysia.

220
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,520
ALEX: But how are we gonna find
the Malaysian animatron?

221
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,960
He turned the Petronas Towers' elevators
into a deadly ride on the tape.

222
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,560
That's where we're headed.

223
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,520
OK, so how exactly does one go about
deactivating an animatron?

224
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,120
This Mini-Lint Vac Battery De-Charger
should suck the life out of him.

225
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,120
But how do we get close enough?

226
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Now I can get as close as I want
to that phony Prime Minister.

227
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,960
Uh-oh. Jerry forgot to charge
the battery. How techno-lame.

228
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,720
Doesn't he know it's like a cell phone?
No juice, no use.

229
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,560
- SAM: That's it!
- What's it?

230
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,160
Your cell phone! We can use the
power from that. Give it to me.

231
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,640
What if I get a really important call?

232
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Here you go. Now be careful,
it might be slightly more powerful.

233
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,200
- Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister, sir.
- Yes, Soldier?

234
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,400
Uh, are my medals on correctly?

235
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,480
Back off, you creep!

236
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,360
(yells)

237
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,640
Get out of the way! He's gonna blow!

238
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,520
One down. Now let's take care
of the rest of the world.

239
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,320
(cheering)

240
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,120
- Where to next, the land down under?
- I don't know about under,

241
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,560
but we'll be going down if Eisenstein
has anything to say about it.

242
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
We've got to protect the world leaders.
I'll put us on autopilot.

243
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,920
- Look out!
- Help me, please!

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Everyone stay calm!
We've got the situation under control!

245
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,560
Hello, ladies, so nice to see you again.

246
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Puh-lease. We've taken down
your little henchmen robots before.

247
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,440
Hmm. Yes, that's true. Perhaps this time
they should have some support.

248
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,120
(they yell)

249
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,480
On second thought, everybody panic!

250
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,200
Eliminate them all!

251
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,040
Maybe if we just hide back here,
they'll go away.

252
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
That'll teach you to mess with my hair!

253
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,320
We have to get the leaders out of here.

254
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Sucks, don't it?

255
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Spread out!

256
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Huh?

257
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
ALEX: Hello?!

258
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
You heard your boss. Eliminate me!

259
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,360
I hope you're equipped with
built-in parachutes.

260
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,280
- Quick! Everyone into the tube!
- (panicked yelling)

261
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
Time to let the CATS out of the bag.

262
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,920
EISENSTEIN: Help! Help me! Help!

263
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
- We really should help him out.
- BOTH: Alright.

264
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Ready to give up your practice, Doc?

265
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,720
(gasps) You're an animatron?!

266
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,520
But if he's an animatron,
then someone had to build him.

267
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,720
Unless he built himself,
but I don't see how. My head hurts.

268
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,920
The real live Dr. Eisenstein created me
in his image before he passed on.

269
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,960
- It was his way of being im...
- Immature?

270
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,120
Immortal. But unfortunately,
he programmed me to self-destruct

271
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
if I ever gave out that information.

272
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,560
(slowly)
Well, girls, it was fun while it lasted.

273
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,360
OK, that was, like, totally unexpected.

274
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
Look. This must control the animatrons.

275
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,880
Hopefully that's the end of
Dr. Eisenstein's robots forever.

276
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's get inside the plane
and get these leaders home.

277
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
Hello? Anybody home?

278
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,920
Thank you so much for saving my husband.

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Yes, excellent work, girls.

280
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,920
It was our pleasure.

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,560
Yeah, it was the least we could do
for a fellow WOOHP spy.

282
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,440
You girls should take a vacation
after that assignment.

283
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,720
Why bother? We've been everyplace
in the world in the last 24 hours.

284
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Everyplace except home.

285
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,600
TV:<i> This week on "Troy's Bayou"...</i>

286
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,760
SAM: What gives, you lamos?
Let's go to the roller blade park.

287
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,720
You want to go to the roller blade park?

288
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,520
Yeah! All that talk about thrill rides
got me psyched up to have fun.

289
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,120
- Go away. I'm wiped.
- Drained.

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,120
(sighs) You're right.
We should stay home, blob out,

291
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,280
- and order some yummy take out.
- BOTH: Love it.

292
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,560
Hello? Yes, I'd like to order egg rolls,
shrimp fried rice and some...

293
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,120
- Clover and Alex No Fun!
- Oh, no!

294
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,360
Clover and Alex No Fun,
Clover and Alex No Fun.

295
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,920
SAM: Hey, this is fun!
Clover and Alex No Fun!

296
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,920
Aw, Clover and Alex are tired!
Clover and Alex No Fun!

297
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
(laughs) Eat my dust!
