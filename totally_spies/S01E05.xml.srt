00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,320
the Bora Bora Resort Hotel
is proud to welcome the recipients

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,440
of the Achievements In Science Award.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
Enjoy your retreat.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,000
Look!

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,680
They're beautiful!
I've never seen anything like that!

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,640
SCIENTIST: It's a new species!

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,400
They're beautiful! (gasps)

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
(all scream)

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
(groans)

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,800
(beeping)

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>What's going on? Where am I?</i>

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,080
(evil laughter)

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
(whirring)

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,240
{\an8}MAN OVER PA SYSTEM:<i>Don't forget,</i>
<i>students, Monday is school picture day.</i>

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
<i>Let's all try to look our best.</i>

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,160
{\an8}SAM: I am so not ready for picture day!

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,000
Tell me about it!
I totally don't know what to wear!

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,280
Should I smile this year
or go for the classic pout?

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
(camera clicks)

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Hello, pathetic wannabes.

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm getting my hair done
by Maurice Maurice,

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,240
the greatest stylist in the world.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,800
Only a master such as he
can do justice to my beautiful locks!

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,480
(all yawn)

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
(laughs)

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,360
(screams) My hair! Help!

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,280
Oh, thank goodness!
Sam, you... you saved my life!

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,080
I saved your hair, Mandy.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,200
(screams)

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,040
My hair is my life!
I am forever in your debt!

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,320
From now on we are friends!

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,960
I'll pick you up tonight to go to
that new dance club, best friend.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Uh.. .no, thanks.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,960
No need to thank me.
See you at eight, B.F.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,480
Or we could go to a movie?
Or get something to eat?

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,800
How about a latte?

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,760
This would be like the best time
to be pulled away to WOOHP!

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,280
(all yell)

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Sam? Sam?

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,320
JERRY: Hello, ladies!

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
That was perfect timing. Thanks, Jerry.

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,080
I have something to show you.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,440
Ten of the world's top scientists
were at a conference in Bora Bora

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,320
when something very odd happened.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
GIRLS: Bora Bora?!

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,600
Hello.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,400
CLOVER: Those are so cute!

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,400
SAM: Eww! Those are so gross!

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes, well those cute gross blobs erased
the scientists' memories completely.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,920
WOOHP needs you to find out
who is behind this and stop them.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,160
This could potentially have
dangerous global ramifications.

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,800
Now, let's get your equipment.

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,280
JERRY: This is MUCA.

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Multi Use Cranium Apparatus.

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,800
Everything you need
to sustain yourself underwater.

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,720
Cool, do you have one in fuchsia?

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Nuclear Powered Jet Boots
for underwater propulsion.

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Waist Restrainers containing
titanium grappling hooks,

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
a repellent spear pistol
and infusion exploders.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
And LIAB 9,000.

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,160
"Lab In A Briefcase"
for on-the-spot analysis.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,640
And, you'll need to bone up
on your marine biology.

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,440
We have to study?

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,880
Last but not least, Supercycles.

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,000
Voice-activated. Each cycle recognizes
your own particular voice.

76
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,160
Simple commands,
such as "go", "faster", etc.

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,280
You tell the bike what to do
and it does it.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,840
Allow me to demonstrate.

79
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,320
JERRY: "Start!"

80
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,840
(engine revving)

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,840
GIRLS: Cool!

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
(chuckles)

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,920
They're very sensitive.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
GIRLS: Stop!

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,200
GIRLS: Wow!

86
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
There's no time to lose.

87
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,680
- You must leave right...
- Wait! I can't go!

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,120
- Why not?
- I left my new sunglasses at home.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,440
ALEX AND SAM: Clover, please!

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,200
You didn't expect me
to go to a tropical island

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,400
without my new sunglasses, did you?

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Come on, Clover!

93
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,880
Sam-my! Hey, girl!

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
Ready to hit the dance club?

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
Uh, Mandy... I can't.

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,920
I've got to visit my,
my... uh... sick aunt.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,480
Ew! I hate sick aunts!

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,400
But, OK, I can help.

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,240
Any relative of yours
is a relative of mine!

100
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
No thanks. She's got...uh...
Monkeynucleosis.

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,840
Very rare and very contagious.

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,160
I wouldn't want you to get it. Gotta go!

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
Oh!

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,280
Now, this is where
the attack took place.

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Working undercover
as tourists is the best!

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,120
Cool it! We're supposed to be
investigating here!

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,520
Who says you can't tan and
investigate at the same time?

108
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,960
Oh!

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,160
OH!

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,000
Ew! Blob juice!

111
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Don't! That's evidence!

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,680
Huh, the blobs aren't organic.
They're man-made.

113
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,840
Somebody manufactured these things!

114
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,120
We'll send this to WOOHP
for further analysis.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,280
Now, let's check out those scientists.

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
SCIENTIST 1: Who are you?

117
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,480
SCIENTIST 2: Who am I?

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
SCIENTIST 3: Where am I?

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,040
Mommy?

120
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Hi. My name's Clover.
I'm taking biology this year.

121
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,160
When you get your memory back,
you can help me on my mid-term.

122
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Uh, who is biology?

123
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
(all scream)

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,240
<i>Mr Hannigan, I will only say this once.</i>

125
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,640
<i>One billion dollars must be left</i>
<i>at Black Death Cove</i>

126
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,640
<i>by tomorrow morning at dawn.</i>

127
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,800
<i>If not, I promise you will regret it.</i>

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
(all gasp)

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,040
This is the most horrible thing
I could ever imagine!

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Hey, Sam! Hello!

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,080
No, that is the most horrible thing
you could ever imagine!

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,480
What a totally amazing surprise!

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,440
I needed to get a tan for the
school pictures. I look like a mime!

134
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,800
And this is my favorite tanning beach
in the whole world!

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,600
- Where's Auntie Monkeynucleosis?
- "Auntie" who?

136
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,280
Oh, oh, yeah! She-she got better.

137
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,480
Great! Now we don't have to
take care of that cranky loon!

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,920
We can hang out together cos that's
what best friends are for, right?

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,680
So, what exactly are
you all doing here, Sam?

140
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,160
GIRLS: Uh... Um... Well...

141
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,520
The hotel hired us
to give dance lessons!

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,400
(dance music)

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,840
(Alex cheers)

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,120
This is the lamest thing
I have ever seen in my entire life.

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,160
(yawns)

146
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,360
Mandy needs her beauty sleep!

147
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,120
Night, Sam.
Meet me at the bazaar tomorrow morning.

148
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,960
We'll go shopping. Just lose the losers!

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,960
See ya!

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,400
You better get rid of your friend!

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,040
She is not my friend!

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
You know I have a prom coming up...

153
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,680
SAM: Clover! Come on!

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
(beeping)

155
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,800
OK, we wait here with the money
till somebody shows up.

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Just let me know when
the bad guys get here.

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,840
- The bad guys are here!
- What?

158
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,480
ALEX: Only two of them?
This should be easy.

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
Yeah, too easy.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,840
(men gasp)

161
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,920
(grunts)

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
GIRLS: Run!

163
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
(all cough)

164
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,080
- CLOVER: This is so bad for my skin!
- SAM: C'mon, let's get 'em!

165
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,520
- SAM: Go!
- ALEX: Go!

166
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah! Oh, I mean "go"!

167
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,120
(Clover shrieks)

168
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
We'll never catch them!

169
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,360
Let's speed it up. Ready?
One, two, three.

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,080
GIRLS: Faster!

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,600
GIRLS: Super sonic!

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,240
(tires squeal)

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Hey!

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Turn around!

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,640
Go the other way!

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
(Alex screams)

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
Wow! Hi!

178
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,160
Not you!

179
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,800
(gasps)

180
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
(growls)

181
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
(horns blare)

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,680
ALEX: What the...?

183
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,000
(engines rev)

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Wait!

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
(horns blaring)

186
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
There it is!

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
MAN: Hey!

188
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,920
This chase is over, buddy!

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,640
I don't think so!

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,760
(screams)

191
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,800
ALEX: Sam!

192
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,440
- Sam!
- Are you all right?

193
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,680
Sam! I've been looking all over for you!
Look at these fabulous things I got!

194
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,560
I am going to look gorgeous in these!

195
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
W-who are you?

196
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,640
She got blobbed!

197
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,720
"Blobbed"? Ew! What is going on?

198
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
Uh... we were just playing a game!

199
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,160
Yeah! It's called "Who Are You?"

200
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
Who are you?!

201
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,640
Sam is really good at it!

202
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,960
I want to play, too!

203
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,480
Uh, sure, you can play the next round,
but you have to play it on jet skis.

204
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
Right! Round two is on jet skis.

205
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
So, go rent a jet ski
and we'll meet you at the marina!

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Jet skis!

207
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,080
- CLOVER: Go!
- ALEX: Ciao!

208
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
CLOVER: Go!

209
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
(coughs)

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,760
Jerry, Sam got hit by a blob
and lost her memory!

211
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,720
<i>Don't let her out of your sight.</i>
<i>She's safest with you.</i>

212
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
<i>Listen, I have new information.</i>

213
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,360
<i>We analyzed the blob residue and</i>
<i>traced it to a man named Lester Crowley.</i>

214
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,680
<i>A janitor?</i>

215
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,440
Well, he was a janitor at
The Brooks Marine Biology Institute.

216
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
JERRY:<i>He wanted to be a scientist.</i>

217
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
<i>He tried some</i>
<i>experimenting on his own.</i>

218
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,360
<i>At night he secretly worked on a cure</i>
<i>for memory loss using sea creatures.</i>

219
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,040
<i>He was discovered, fired and arrested.</i>

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,760
<i>He escaped, stealing millions</i>
<i>of dollars worth of equipment.</i>

221
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,600
<i>You need to find him. Fast! Good luck!</i>

222
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,520
Marine biologist wannabe, huh?

223
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,080
I think I know where
we should start looking.

224
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
I wish someone would tell me
what is going on!

225
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,600
OK. Your name is Sam.

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,760
SAM: "Sam"? Am I a man?

227
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
No! You're a girl.

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,680
(beeping)

229
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,960
Switch on helmet subs. Down!

230
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
CLOVER:<i>You sure these</i>
<i>are made for water landing?</i>

231
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,760
ALEX:<i>Of course they are!</i>

232
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,960
(screaming)

233
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,680
CLOVER:<i>The Lester Crowley</i>
<i>Underwater Research Institute.</i>

234
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,600
- CLOVER:<i>I think this is it!</i>
<i>-</i>SAM:<i>How are we going to get in?</i>

235
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,360
(all scream)

236
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,840
<i>Subtle, no. Effective, yes.</i>

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,560
SAM:<i>Hey</i>?<i>What am I supposed to do</i>?

238
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,920
ALEX AND CLOVER:<i>Shh</i>!

239
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,080
SAM: Can I go home, please?
Wherever my home is.

240
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
This is not fun at all!

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
(machines clank)

242
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,280
(beeping)

243
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,360
That's our man!

244
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,520
We will now implement the final phase.

245
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,200
I will unleash my vengeance upon
the world and then... utter chaos.

246
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,080
I will hold the world's
memories in my hand...

247
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,960
We have to sneak back out,
get reinforcements and then...

248
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
SAM: Hey! You in the white coat!

249
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,520
Do you know who I am?

250
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
Seize them!

251
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,800
Was that a bad thing to do?

252
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,760
You look like intelligent young girls.

253
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,520
I think you'll enjoy a demonstration

254
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,440
of the hatching process
of my blobs, observe.

255
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,680
After hatching, they search
for the closest human brain

256
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,640
and suck the memory out!

257
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,240
I must go, but I do hope you
enjoy the demonstration.

258
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,800
Is this like an initiation into
a secret club or something?

259
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
(rumbling)

260
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,480
(all groan)

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
(all groan)

262
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
(all scream)

263
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
(growling)

264
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,640
(screams)

265
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
(Mandy screams)

266
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,440
Ow! I can't believe I'm saying this
but, "Thanks, Mandy."

267
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,200
What is going on here?

268
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,600
Uh... We're still playing "Who are you?"

269
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
Wow! This is a really elaborate game.

270
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,120
Excuse me, but this "game"
is way out of control!

271
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,000
- What about Mandy?
- No time to worry about her.

272
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,160
She's safe below and more importantly,
she's not following us!

273
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,480
(gasps)

274
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
(Mandy screams)

275
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,640
Preparing approach to New York City.

276
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,560
(grunting)

277
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,400
CLOVER: Gee, you think he'd have
a bunch of guards in here.

278
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,560
(gasps)

279
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,120
Hey! I was right!

280
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,480
(all scream)

281
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,960
(guards gasp)

282
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,640
(guard screams)

283
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
(karate yell)

284
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
(laughs)

285
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,920
(grunts and screams)

286
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,600
(screams)

287
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,800
(yells and grunts)

288
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,160
- Gotcha!
- I don't feel so good.

289
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,240
What are you doing here?

290
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,760
Uh, do you have any
of those little bags?

291
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,160
I think I'm gonna barf.

292
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
OK, Crowley! It's over!

293
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,720
Turn the plane around!

294
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,880
OK, tell me right now
exactly what is going on!

295
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
(screaming)

296
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,800
We've gotta destroy
the rest of those blobs!

297
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,320
If we can jam the machine,
we might be able to.

298
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,480
(grunts)

299
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,360
Can't... reach.. .the switch!

300
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,560
Need something long.

301
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,240
My hair! Sam! Help me!

302
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,160
(Mandy screams)

303
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,560
CLOVER: It's gonna blow!

304
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
(screams)

305
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,800
No! No!

306
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,120
(struggling)

307
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,920
Uh, excuse me, spy girls?

308
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,440
I know you're busy tying up
the bad guy and everything,

309
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
but who exactly is flying this plane?

310
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,400
(screaming)

311
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,040
Hey! What about me? Help!

312
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,960
(explosion)

313
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,160
OK, I saved you, but I do not
want you as my best friend! Got it?

314
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
(groans)

315
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
OK, Crowley,
we gotta restore Sam's memory.

316
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,560
Where's the thingy
with all the memories?

317
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,080
(growls)

318
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
Huh?

319
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,280
- Sam, do you know who you are?
- Duh! I'm Sam.

320
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
We're spies for the World Organization
of Human Protection, ya know, WOOHP.

321
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
You two look tired.

322
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah, well, it's been
kind of a long day!

323
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,400
ALEX: You're back!

324
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,640
So, have we found out who's behind this?

325
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,960
Did WOOHP get anything
from the blob residue?

326
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,320
(laughs)

327
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Hi, Mandy. Did we...?
What is she doing up here?

328
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Oh, oh my! My gosh! You're all spies!

329
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,000
I cannot wait to tell everyone
about this at school!

330
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,880
- Girls, we've got a problem here.
- I don't think so.

331
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
(Mandy screams)

332
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm glad we erased the part
of Mandy's memory

333
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
so she doesn't remember
we're you-know-whats.

334
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah. It's so great to have
the old Mandy back!

335
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,160
Why are you girls even bothering
to get your pictures taken?

336
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,520
You'll never look as gorgeous as me!

337
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,240
Are my perfect teeth in focus?

338
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,840
Hey, Monkey Boy,
you are shooting perfection here!

339
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Work with me!

340
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
MANDY: I knew I should have brought
my own photographer!

341
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,960
GIRLS: Cheese!
