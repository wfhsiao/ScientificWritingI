MAN: Give it up.
Prepare to meet your demise.

12

Give up!

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,800
(screams)

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,760
(cheering)

15
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
{\an8}(shrieking)

16
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
{\an8}Look at that.
We made it to school in record time.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,320
{\an8}Think of how much more time
we could have saved

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,760
{\an8}if those pedestrians would have just
stayed off the sidewalks.

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,400
Cool motorcycle.
Who's the intense biker babe?

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,120
That must be Donna Ramone. I heard
she was just released from juvie.

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Looks more like
she escaped from juvie.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
Come on, guys.
I'm sure she's perfectly nice.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,760
Hi, I'm Alex.
I don't think we've met.

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
- Oops!
- (growls)

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,440
You know what happened
to the last person who touched my ride?

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's just say she eats her dinner
through a straw these days!

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,120
(laughs awkwardly) What a coincidence.
I like protein shakes, too.

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
(school bell rings)

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Oh, gee. There goes the bell.
See you around.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
(Donna shrieks)

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,160
Oops. Sorry.

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
(whistle sounds)

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Maybe I'll just use the entrance
at the other end of the school.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,280
(grunts) What a stressful day.
I hope I never see that thug again.

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,240
At least they're serving my favorite
lunch today, soy cheese pizza.

36
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,400
- I'll take that.
- Hey, give me my pizza back!

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,520
Not a chance.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Way I figure, you owe me lunch money
for a year after what happened today.

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Alex, you're not going to let her
extort you like that.

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, stand up for yourself!

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,360
I... I'm not gonna pay.
In fact... I want my pizza back!

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,840
On second thought,
you can keep it.

43
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm gonna turn you
into my own personal hand puppet!

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,000
- (shrieks)
- GIRL: Teacher!

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,120
You're lucky... for now.

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,520
But tomorrow at three o'clock,
you're dead meat.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,960
ALEX: You hear that? I'm dead meat.

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't sweat it, Alex.
I'm sure this'll all blow over.

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,760
When it does, give me a call.
Until then, I'll be at the North Pole.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
(all scream)

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
Can I offer you girls a sandwich?

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
- No, thanks. We just ate.
- Some of us did.

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,320
Have you ever heard
of a television show called<i>Fight?</i>

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,160
That wrestling show
that takes place on the island?

55
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,120
That's the one.<i>Fight.</i>Fear Island
Gladiator Habi-Tat.<i>Fight.</i>

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,240
I love that show. What's up?

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Well, it seems that what's up is
one of the contestants,

58
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,520
an Olympic decathlete
named Reggie Willis,

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,160
hasn't been heard from
since losing on the show.

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,360
I wouldn't mind getting lost with him.
He's hot.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,680
Yes, well, in addition to being hot,

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,400
he's supposed to represent the United
States in the Olympics next month.

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,280
Which brings us to your mission.

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,160
I want you girls to go undercover
on<i>Fight</i>

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,840
to find out what happened to him.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,800
- Undercover in what capacity?
- As contestants, of course.

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
I was afraid he'd say that.

68
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,640
And now for your gadgets.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Zip-line bracelets, parachute belts,
mini-ski aerobic sneakers,

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,560
laser heat hairdryers,
buzzsaw wristwatches

71
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,920
and lip balm smoke bombs.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,040
Ooh! I could use a little lip relief.

73
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
(all shriek)

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Enjoy the mission, girls.

75
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,800
This is Fear Island?
I don't see anything scary about it.

76
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
(horn honking)

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,440
I stand corrected.

78
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,880
Vince King's the name,
promoting human combat is my game!

79
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
You must be our new contestants!

80
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,560
That's right.
I'm Sam, and this is Clover and Alex.

81
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
Terrific.
Let me give you the grand tour.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,720
KING:<i>Fight</i>is
an international sensation.

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,720
It's seen in every nation
of the world.

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Every terrain of the world is
represented on my island.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,160
<i>Fight</i>has
the most fantastic playing field

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
in any sport ever conceived!

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,800
This is remarkable.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Arnold, has Donna cooled down yet?
Did she call off the fight?

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,960
<i>Are you kidding?</i>
<i>Things are just starting to heat up.</i>

90
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,240
<i>Smart money's on Donna,</i>
<i>but you're an attractive long shot.</i>

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,360
Ooh!

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
So, Mr King, have you heard about
the disappearance of Reggie Willis?

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,120
Probably afraid to show his face
in public

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,480
after his brutal defeat
at the hands of my merciless gladiators.

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Brutal? Merciless? Are you saying
that the fighting on your show is real?

96
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh, of course not. It's just... showbiz.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,800
All of our action is choreographed
and safety is a premium.

98
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
(girls coughing)

99
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,480
Hit the dressing room, ladies.
Suit up and meet me on stage.

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
The show starts in an hour!

101
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,200
And I thought Sam's driving was bad.

102
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,440
(coughs)

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,120
ALEX: What is this, a wedgie suit?

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
(cheering)

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Tell me about it. No wonder
everyone on this island wants to fight.

106
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Now, let's meet the contestants!

107
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,360
(crowd cheers)

108
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,240
The lovely Sam, Alex, and Clover

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,160
will risk
life and limb to try and win this.

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,640
The coveted<i>Fight</i>belt!

111
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
(whoops)

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,800
But first they have to make it past

113
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,040
my highly trained, hand-picked
international gladiators!

114
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you ready?

115
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
(crowd cheers)

116
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,080
On your mark, girls. Get set...

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,080
Release the wolves!

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,120
!ALL: Wolves?

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,080
Pick up the pace, girls!
Those wolves look awfully hungry!

120
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,040
And we look like lunch!

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,520
Please!
King said this is all just showbiz.

122
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,560
These pups wouldn't hurt a fly.

123
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
Apparently no one told the wolves
it's only showbiz.

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,920
- ALEX: Great! What now?
- Climb up!

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,040
Is there still time to throw ourselves
to the wolves?

126
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Get off my back!

127
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,400
Yay!

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, great. The one day I forget
to use moisture-wear eyeliner.

129
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Over there!

130
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
(crowd cheers)

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,080
Huh? What do I have to do
to get rid of these guys?

132
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,680
Get your hands off me.
I'm not your prom date!

133
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Uh-oh.

134
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
See you next fall.

135
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,840
(gladiators scream)

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,240
(crowd cheers)

137
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,880
I hope this outfit isn't dry-clean-only.

138
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,760
Hmm? Hello. What do we have here?

139
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
{\an8}Whoa.

140
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
This island has everything
except a mall.

141
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
There she is!

142
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,160
- Give it up, sweetheart.
- Not a chance.

143
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,920
Don't these beefcakes ever take a break?

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,640
A sewer in an ancient city? Oh, well.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,520
<i>How's the mission going?</i>

146
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Great, if you like running
for your life from homicidal gladiators.

147
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,680
<i>Bad news. It turns out several more</i>
<i>athletes who competed on "Fight"</i>

148
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,080
<i>have seemingly vanished.</i>

149
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,200
That's not hard to imagine.
Gotta go.

150
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,800
What the...?

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,400
Seize them!

152
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
(gasps)

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,840
I'd give my entire shoe collection
for some relief from this heat.

154
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
Ouch!

155
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,800
Not exactly what I had in mind.

156
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,120
(crowd cheers)

157
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
Yay!

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
Mind if I borrow this?

159
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,960
(crowd cheers)

160
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,160
Help! I'm drowning!

161
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,480
Why do I have to be such a nice person?

162
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,880
What's this gaudy thing?

163
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,720
This is the farthest anyone's
ever made it!

164
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,480
Who are these girls?

165
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,720
- Sammy!
- Alex, you're alive!

166
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,560
Just barely. The island's crawling
with those muscleheads.

167
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,880
(rustling)

168
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,800
- BOTH: Clover!
- You can get off me anytime now.

169
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,640
I got a hunch that Reggie
never left the island.

170
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,960
Not alive, at least.

171
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
The quicker we find out what happened
to Reggie,

172
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,760
the quicker we can get off this island.

173
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,720
Maybe the underground captives can
give us some answers.

174
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,440
I saw them in the sewer when I was
running from the gladiators. Weird, huh?

175
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,680
Come to think of it,
I saw something weird, too.

176
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
A satellite was following me
down by the river.

177
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,200
And then suddenly it disappeared.

178
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,680
Does this qualify as weird?
It came off one of the gladiators.

179
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,640
Looks like an electronic collar.

180
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,440
Prisoners, a satellite
and an electronic collar.

181
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,320
King is definitely up to something.

182
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,640
I think it's time to talk
to the prisoners.

183
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
They're the only people on this island
who haven't tried to destroy us.

184
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,640
CLOVER: For being
glamorous international spies,

185
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
we spend an awful lot of time
creeping through stinky sewers.

186
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,520
ALEX: Wait a second.
These people look familiar.

187
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
They're professional athletes. And
probably former<i>Fight</i>contestants.

188
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,560
And now King is keeping them here
to work on his island.

189
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,160
We've got to save them!

190
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Great! Who's gonna save us?

191
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,440
I've got to hand it to you girls.

192
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,840
You've got the moves.
You've got the skills.

193
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,480
You've made it further
than any other contestant!

194
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,560
But most importantly,
the audience loves you.

195
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,680
Excuse us if we don't seem appreciative
of your compliments.

196
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
That's OK.

197
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,360
You can show your appreciation
by working as warriors on my island.

198
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,800
And once I whip you into shape,
I think you'll make fine gladiators.

199
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,200
Uh, as if.

200
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,920
You must be out of your mind

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,600
if you think you're gonna turn us
into gladiators.

202
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh, I'm not.
But my Temperament Collars will.

203
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,680
ALL: Huh?

204
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,320
I can control the moods of every
gladiator with a remote control.

205
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,040
I can make my gladiators
as docile as kitties

206
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,760
or as vicious as cornered pit-bulls.

207
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,160
And you do it all from the comfort
and safety of your studio.

208
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,400
You never even have
to get your hands dirty.

209
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
That's the idea.

210
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,880
Fit them with the collars.
I need to check our ratings.

211
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
CLOVER: Reggie!

212
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,280
I don't know how to repay you.

213
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,000
You saved me when you fished me out
of that lake and pulled my collar off.

214
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,480
That was you?
There's no need to repay me.

215
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
But I like foreign movies,
white roses and chocolate.

216
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,240
Rude way to show your appreciation, Sam.

217
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,280
It's her collar. It's been activated.

218
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,560
You'll never capture
the<i>Fight</i>belt!

219
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,760
We gladiators will never allow it!

220
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,320
CLOVER: We've got to save Sam.

221
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,640
How can we while she's under
the power of that collar?

222
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,560
She's got that crazy look in her eyes,

223
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,960
like when there's a half-off sale
at the mall.

224
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,280
If we can't take off the collar,
maybe we can block King's signal.

225
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,560
If we could only find the origin...

226
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,760
Wait a second.

227
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Maybe the signal has something
to do with that satellite.

228
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,120
I've seen the satellite, too.
It's worth a shot.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
(crowd cheers)

230
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
This isn't right!
They're supposed to have collars on!

231
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,240
Let's see how they do
against my gladiators now.

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,240
There it is!

233
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,400
How are we going to take out
the satellite

234
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
with those super gladiators out there?

235
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,880
If we could just get past them,
maybe we could scale the cliff.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,800
If we only had a decoy.

237
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,800
(sighs) Why am I always the decoy?

238
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,360
Hey, knuckleheads! Here I am!
Think you can catch me?

239
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,560
Stop her!

240
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
(crowd cheers)

241
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,600
No one wins on my show!

242
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,960
My gladiators are unbeatable!

243
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,480
I'm unbeatable!

244
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,160
Look out! It's King!

245
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,360
(whoops)

246
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,920
(crowd boos)

247
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,240
Sam? You look tense.

248
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,840
What do you say I take that collar off
and give you a nice relaxing massage?

249
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,320
(screams)

250
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,120
Nice shot. Too bad rock throwing isn't
an Olympic event.

251
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
You'd win the gold for sure.

252
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,840
(screams)

253
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,840
Sam, don't do it!
Don't you remember me?

254
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm Alex! We're best friends!

255
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,400
We were best friends!

256
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
(screams)

257
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,440
You'll never get the belt.
No one beats me!

258
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,240
Reggie...

259
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,880
Hey, King! Your gladiators are
the biggest wimps I've ever fought.

260
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,560
And I'm gonna win that belt.

261
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,400
Reggie, watch out!

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,680
No!

263
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,400
ALEX: Help!

264
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,960
Alex? What are you doing?

265
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,800
What am I doing? What are you doing?
Pull me in!

266
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,840
No! My gladiators!

267
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,080
You did it! You won!

268
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,000
No. We won!

269
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,400
CROWD: Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!

270
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,800
(bell rings)

271
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,960
Isn't it great to be off that island
of fighting gladiators

272
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,640
and back in Beverly Hills?

273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,080
I am so ready to give peace a chance.

274
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
You ready to rumble, wimp?

275
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,200
STUDENTS: Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

276
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,160
(growls)

277
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,040
Listen here, you big Neanderthal!
I've been chased by wild wolves,

278
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,360
had boulders thrown at me
and fought gladiators all night.

279
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,880
So if you want a piece of me,
let's get it on!

280
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,160
Hmm.
For a bony runt, you're pretty tough.

281
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,360
I am? I mean... you bet I am!

282
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,080
I didn't know you had it in you.
Guess you're cooler than I thought.

283
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,920
We're gonna have to get you a ride.

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
We are? Cool!

285
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,840
Well, at least something good
came out of all this.

286
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,520
Yeah? Like what?

287
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,760
Now that Alex is getting a motorcycle,

288
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,640
I won't have to ride to school
with you anymore.

289
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,880
- Ta-da!
- What do you mean? Come back here!
