(rumbling)

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,320
(beeping)

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,120
New WOOHP state-of-the-art technology?

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Pull-ease. The Evapo-Blaster's
nothing but a glorified hairdryer.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
I agree! That mission was totally lame.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,360
I mean, "avalanche patrol".
What are we spies, or forest rangers?

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,800
Neither, apparently
we're goat babysitters.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,960
{\an8}ALEX: I thought this whole spy gig
was supposed to be fun.

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,880
{\an8}So much for the days of exciting
missions in exotic places.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,640
At least we can be psyched about our
big snowboarding trip this weekend!

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
What do you say we forget about
Jerry and his boring missions

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,840
and focus on what is really important.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,040
(both exclaim)

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,880
Oh, it's fabulous!

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
<i>But don't you think it's a bit tight</i>
<i>for snowboarding?</i>

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,920
(screams) It's hardly
any of your business!

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Now bug off!

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,400
(Clover shrieks)

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
(screams)

30
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
(sighs)

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
JERRY:<i>A-hem.</i>

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
(tuts)

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,320
(beeping)

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,320
- Alex here.
-<i>I've noticed your grades have slipped.</i>

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
<i>I've arranged for you to be tutored</i>

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,480
<i>by our top WOOHP scholar</i>
<i>every day after school.</i>

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,800
<i>No need to thank me.</i>
<i>I'm just happy to help where I can.</i>

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,520
(groans)

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,560
OK, being a spy has just gone
from mundane to ridiculous.

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
We can't even get ready for our trip
without Jerry bugging us!

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Tell me about it!
That man is the absolute worst!

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
We should give him a piece of our minds!

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,880
I totally agree.
It's high time we put our feet down!

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
(all gasp)

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,040
(buzzing)

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,120
(all scream)

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,440
Well, you know what they say,
no time like the present!

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,960
(screaming continues)

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
(Clover sighs)

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,280
(shrieks)

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
OK, Jerry, enough is enough!

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,880
That's right! We're sick of you
butting into our personal lives!

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,880
Yeah, and no more
treating us like little girls!

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,880
Do I make myself cl...cl...clear?

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Crystal clear.

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Hello, girls. I'm Mac Smit.
Your new WOOHP guardian.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,680
You're our new guardian?
What happened to Jerry?

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Jerry decided after 35
wonderful years with WOOHP

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,560
it was time he worked on his golf game.

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,000
He's retired.

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,040
<i>It's true, ladies.</i>
<i>I have indeed retired.</i>

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
<i>I am, however, confident I've left you</i>
<i>in very capable hands.</i>

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,560
<i>Mac should prove to be</i>
<i>a fine replacement.</i>

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,000
So, does this mean we're never
going to see you again, Jer?

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,000
<i>Sorry, I can't help you. I'm retired!</i>

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,960
I can't believe Jerry retired.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,760
It seems like just yesterday

68
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,000
he was invading our privacy and
majorly getting on our nerves.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,000
We'll have plenty of time
to get acquainted later, girls.

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,960
Right now I need you to gather around
cos I have a really important mission.

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,560
Great, this guy's gonna be
a pain in the butt just like Jerry.

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,120
The first thing you'll need
for this mission

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
is an official WOOHP
Platinum Credit Card.

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,560
Did you just say Platinum Credit Card?

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,200
That's right. WOOHP gave me
a couple of new cards this morning.

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,640
Your first mission is to go shopping
on the organization's dime!

77
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,600
I know this fabulous
new department store in Paris.

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
GIRLS: Paris?!

79
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
B-but what about our gadgets?
Jerry always gives us gadgets.

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,360
OK, here's the Parasol Crossbow,
the Backpack Jetpack,

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,520
the Crime-Scene Scanner Watch,

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,520
the Tornado-In-A-Can of Hairspray,

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,480
and a tube of Immobilizing
Stun-tan Lotion.

84
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
Have fun!

85
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
(all yell)

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,160
{\an8}It's official, Mac's the best.
The total, ultimate coolest!

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,120
You can say that again.

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,920
But he's also... so cool and smart.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll call Jerry to see what
he might like for a retirement gift.

90
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
Hey, Jer. It's Alex. Just wondering
what you might like as a retirement...

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,800
<i>Sorry, I can't help you. I'm retired!</i>

92
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
- Rude much?
- Don't worry about it.

93
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
Yeah, Jerry's loss is totally our gain!

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Maybe I'll buy a gift for Mac!

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,640
After all, a little generosity
could go a long way.

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,600
What the...? (screams)

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,000
SAM: Run for it!

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,600
(shoppers scream)

99
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
(all yell)

100
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,320
(beeping)

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Oh, man! What a waste.
Those were cashmere!

102
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Time for a little retaliation.

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,320
OK. That's a little more purchasing
power than I was looking for.

104
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
We better get back to WOOHP
and tell Mac what happened.

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,520
CLOVER: Nice suit.

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,520
Wow. Back so soon?

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,720
Yeah. We, uh, had a little "problem"
with the credit card.

108
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Not that we didn't totally
appreciate you giving it to us.

109
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,320
What? Was it declined or something?

110
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,360
No. It attacked us with its
whirling saw blades of death.

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
We barely made it
out of the store alive!

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,960
Um, for you. Sorry I didn't have time
to get it gift wrapped.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Oh! You girls can't be serious!

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Unfortunately, we are serious
and so is the $200,000 bill for damages

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
you'll be receiving from the store.

116
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,280
Doesn't it even bother you that we were
almost shredded by a killer credit card?

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,800
Alex, Mac is a seasoned agent.

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,520
He's probably been in so many
dangerous situations,

119
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,360
stuff like this doesn't faze him.

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,600
Girls, I apologize. You've got to
let me make this up to you.

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,040
How about a cliff-diving
adventure in Acapulco?

122
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,520
I think we've had enough
international excitement for one day.

123
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,920
Well, then the least I can do
is offer you a ride home in style.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Take my brand-new Turbo Titan 3,000 XT.

125
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Just bought it yesterday.
Still has that new car smell.

126
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,440
GIRLS: Wow!

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,000
(giggles) Well, if you insist...

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,720
This is totally awesome!

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,760
I mean, could Mac possibly
be any more money?

130
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,760
He's got the brains, he's kinda cute
and his car's the bomb!

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Tell me about it.
This car practically drives itself!

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,920
(tyres squeal)

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
CLOVER: Oh, sunglasses!

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,280
What do we need sunglasses for?
It's night-time.

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,400
It's not a question of function,
it's a question of fashion.

136
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,520
(explosion)

137
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240
(all scream)

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
Whoa, I guess this car
really is the bomb.

139
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
I wonder what could have caused this?

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,040
The question is,
who could have caused this?

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,440
Huh?

142
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
(beeping)

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,120
- SAM: Bingo!
- ALEX: What is it?

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,320
A fingerprint. A fingerprint that
belongs to a criminal named Tim Scam!

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,360
Man, his rap sheet's longer than
Clover's list of past boyfriends!

146
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
Well, almost.

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Uh-oh. We should warn Mac.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,480
I mean, first the evil credit card
and now this.

149
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,880
SAM: I think this Tim guy's after him!

150
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Huh, there's no answer.

151
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
We better get to WOOHP and warn him.

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,160
And how exactly are we gonna do that?

153
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, in case you forgot,
our ride exploded.

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,760
CLOVER: Well, if we can't drive,
let's fly!

155
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
SAM AND ALEX: Yeah!

156
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,080
- Where could he be?
- I don't know.

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,600
- But we should leave him a note.
- That says what?

158
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
"In addition to turning your credit card
into a whirling blade of death,

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,400
"some psycho also blew your car into
a billion pieces of scrap metal."

160
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,360
"By the way, let's do lunch."

161
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,560
(gasps)

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
Check this out.

163
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,400
A schematic drawing of the Evapo-Blaster
and a file on Tim Scam.

164
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,480
That's weird, why would Mac have those?

165
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,480
Unless he knows Tim Scam is after him.

166
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,720
Wait a second,
this is a WOOHP employee file.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,840
- That's impossible. That would mean...
- Tim Scam used to work at WOOHP!

168
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,920
According to these records, he was a
WOOHP weapons technician 20 years ago.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,040
But it says here he was fired for
"illegal use of WOOHP technology."

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
What a creep!

171
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,480
We better call Jerry.
I'm sure he remembers Tim Scam.

172
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
After all, he worked here
for, like, 90 years.

173
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,640
Jerry, you've got to help us...

174
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,040
<i>Sorry, I can't help you. I'm retired!</i>

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Très uncouth!

176
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,320
I mean, I don't care if he is retired,
this is an emergency!

177
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,760
Wait a second!

178
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,280
<i>Sorry, I can't help you. I'm retired!</i>

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,960
I knew it! This isn't live!
This is on a tape loop!

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
A tape loop? Why would Jerry do that?

181
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,640
- He wouldn't, but someone else might.
- Someone like...

182
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Tim Scam!

183
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,760
(all gasp)

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,680
Hold it right there!

185
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,240
GIRLS: It's him!

186
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,320
Maybe we could use something in here
to give him the slip.

187
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,000
I get a ticket every time
I drive my car.

188
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,680
How am I supposed to drive
any of these crazy things?

189
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,840
How hard can this be to drive?

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
- What the...?
- Anti-gravity cycles!

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,320
CLOVER: No time for driving lessons!

192
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,480
(screams) As if my hair
isn't brittle enough!

193
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
(roars)

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
I never realized how
creepy this place is!

195
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm glad we work outside the office!

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,880
I think we lost him.

197
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,000
(all scream)

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,960
(screams)
Guess I don't need that wheel after all.

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,840
(Sam screams)

200
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,240
Sammy!

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
Follow my lead!

202
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,120
(yells)

203
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
(all scream)

204
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,560
Ew!

205
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,680
- Where are we?
- Shh!

206
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,920
(footsteps approach/girls gasp)

207
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,240
ALEX AND CLOVER: Mac!

208
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,520
Alex? Clover?

209
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,680
That's strange, why would someone
outfit the Evapo-Blaster

210
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,720
with a missile guidance system?

211
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,600
We're so happy it's you
and not that crazy Tim Scam!

212
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Yeah, he's been chasing us all over
WOOHP and he's after you too!

213
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Hmm, by the way, do you girls still have
your Stun-Tan Lotion on you?

214
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Sure.

215
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,720
So, what are we going
to do about Tim Scam?

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,280
Hey, did you know that your name
backwards spells Tim Scam...?

217
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,480
Whoa, that is a weird coincidence.

218
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
You're Tim Scam!

219
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,600
(all scream)

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,680
Thank goodness you're all right!
I was so worried Tim Scam got to you!

221
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,040
(gasps) Whoa!

222
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
Not so fast.

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,200
(groans) Call Emergency!

224
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,320
I need a deep tissue massage
right this second!

225
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,680
Make it two.

226
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,400
Hey, where's that jerk, Mac Smit
or Tim Scam or whatever his name is?

227
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,160
Forget about that jerk, where are we?

228
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,760
(all gasp)

229
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,720
<i>Try to relax and enjoy the ride, girls.</i>

230
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,520
- Why did you bring us out here?
- And what do you plan to do with that?

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,520
<i>Why, I'm going to use it to evaporate</i>
<i>the entire Earth's water</i>

232
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,480
<i>from the safety of my space ship.</i>

233
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,720
Even for a complete psycho like you,
that's still a really crazy idea.

234
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
-<i>Thank you.</i>
- We read your WOOHP file.

235
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,680
We know all about your criminal past.

236
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,840
<i>WOOHP never did appreciate me</i>
<i>for the genius that I am.</i>

237
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Drop the money!
We've got you surrounded!

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,160
(yells)

239
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
No!

240
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,440
I can't believe I thought you were cool!

241
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,800
You seemed so smart

242
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,080
but now I see you're just another
run-of-the-mill terrorist.

243
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
We are, like, so over!

244
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Yeah, you can just forget about
your crazy little plan,

245
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,200
because you're going to
have to deal with us!

246
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,240
<i>OK. You're dealt with.</i>

247
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,640
<i>Oh, and while you're out there,</i>
<i>tell Jerry I said hello.</i>

248
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
(blast)

249
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,880
(all scream)

250
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,280
(screaming continues)

251
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,640
Finally, my weapons
can be put to good use.

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,840
(sirens blare)

253
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,840
(gasps)

254
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,760
Oh, no. He already started!

255
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,520
We gotta stop him!

256
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,560
What do you think Scam meant by,
"Tell Jerry I said hello"?

257
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
(all gasp)

258
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
GIRLS: Jerry!

259
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,040
Now it all makes sense,
Tim Scam blasted Jerry out here

260
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,000
so he could take Jerry's place
and gain access to WOOHP!

261
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,000
We've got to get to Jerry
before he runs out of oxygen.

262
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,400
- How are we supposed to get to him?
- Wait, I've got it!

263
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,040
Great idea! What's your idea?

264
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,960
I'm going to use the Tornado in a Can
to give us a kick.

265
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
(all scream)

266
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
Oops. I guess I had the can
turned the wrong way.

267
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,760
(all sigh in relief)

268
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,000
(whirring)

269
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,120
We did it! We hooked up to Jerry's pod!

270
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Now take us back to the mother ship!

271
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,000
(laughs) Hey!

272
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,160
It's a good thing there's no gravity
or Jerry would be out of luck.

273
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,360
(inhales deeply)

274
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
Come on, Jerry. You've got at least
a couple more years in you!

275
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,440
(inhales deeply)

276
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,400
(gasps)

277
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
(all sigh in relief)

278
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,040
Jerry's going to be just fine. Come on.

279
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,680
Where could he be?

280
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,160
Judging by that floating ocean
out there, I'd say he can't be far.

281
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
We've got to find the Evapo-Blaster
and send that water to Earth!

282
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,400
I've got your Evapo-Blaster right here.

283
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,960
(all yell)

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Terrific, the one day
I forget my moisturizer!

285
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,040
(yells)

286
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,560
What is this?!

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
(yells)

288
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,360
Let me out of here!

289
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,360
GIRLS: Jerry!

290
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,600
Don't you remember?
I think this was your best weapon ever.

291
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,360
You look like you could use
some liquid refreshment.

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,880
(all scream)

293
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
(sighs)

294
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,880
Thanks so much for saving us, Jerry.

295
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,800
Yeah, I almost feel bad
for calling you a boring, old goat.

296
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,760
You called me a what?

297
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,040
No time to explain.
We gotta get that water back to Earth.

298
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,560
TIM SCAM: Let me out of here!

299
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,480
So, we missed our snowboarding trip
but we at least we saved the world.

300
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,960
And we saved Jerry.

301
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,960
I never thought I'd admit it, but I was
really starting to miss that old goat...

302
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,840
I mean, mature guy.

303
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,280
<i>Good evening, ladies.</i>

304
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,640
<i>Just wanted to stop by and</i>
<i>thank you for saving my life.</i>

305
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,080
Don't sweat it.
After all, you saved our lives too.

306
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,280
<i>Still, I did want to properly</i>
<i>show my appreciation.</i>

307
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,840
<i>And so, I'm sending you on</i>
<i>a surprise ski trip to St. Moritz!</i>

308
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,240
GIRLS: Wow! Thanks! Great! Cool!

309
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,680
<i>But first, I have a mission</i>
<i>for you girls.</i>

310
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,120
<i>I need you to train the entire</i>
<i>WOOHP K-9 division.</i>

311
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,960
<i>That is after you do your homework</i>
<i>and clean your rooms.</i>

312
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,920
