{\an8}I'm gonna get this role.
I'm gonna get this role.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,440
Gonna get this role.
I'm gonna get this role.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400
You really shouldn't put
so much pressure on yourself.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm not. I'm psyching myself up.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
And I'm just looking out
for my best friend.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
Yeah. Practically everybody in
the school is auditioning.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,400
Everybody who's anybody.
Plus a few nobodies.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,120
(growls)

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,760
What are you trying to say, Sam?

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm not good enough to play
the orphan Cosette?

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,400
Of course you are. In fact,
you're the most dramatic person I know.

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,640
- But you learning all those lines?
- What?

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,800
Starring in a play is about
more than just memorizing lines, Sam.

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,400
I wouldn't expect a bookworm like you
to understand art.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,560
That's for true virtuosos,
like Picasso, Da Vinci, Madonna.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
And, of course, me.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
(both laugh)

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
Next! Please.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,200
Oh, Monsieur Valjean.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,960
What ill fortune
to be poor with no family.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh, I even had to, uh, sell my car

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,240
just to be able to get enough to eat.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,160
Thank you. That'll be all, Clover.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,040
- (both applaud)
- Thank you. Thank you, one and all.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm so happy to be playing the role
that I so richly deserve.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,240
I'll be signing autographs
in the lunch room.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,120
Uh, Clover, although that was an
interesting interpretation of<i>Les Mis,</i>

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,560
it's not exactly
what we're looking for.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,600
- Next!
- (shrieks)

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,800
(sobs)

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Clover, aren't you getting
a little carried away?

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,520
- It's just a silly play.
- A silly play?

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,640
This is my career we're talking about.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,520
I mean, how could he not pick me?

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,640
I have perfect hair, perfect teeth.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,040
Plus, I just love Paris.

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,680
I'd like to see Mr Tetley's
teaching credentials.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,640
You know, you should be happy
you didn't get this part.

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,720
I mean, rehearsing over and over.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,160
"Oh, Monsieur Valjean, what ill fortune
to be poor with no family."

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,240
- Sounds like such a drag.
- That's it!

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,480
That was brilliant, Samantha.
You were born to play Cosette.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,680
And I won't take no for an answer.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,600
Uh, thanks a lot, Mr Tetley,
but Clover should really get this part.

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,480
You know, she's a very talented actress.
Plus, she has great teeth.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,000
- See?
- But you've got the makings of a star!

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,280
No, really, Clover's my girlfriend
and I...

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
- Perhaps even a Hollywood star.
- When do rehearsals start?

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,480
"When do rehearsals start?"
I can't believe you, you little traitor!

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,960
It's not my fault I'm star material.

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,160
Cut it out, you guys.
You're supposed to be friends.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Since you girls are
in such a talkative mood,

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
perhaps you would like to tell us

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
what you think the most dramatic scene
in<i>Les Misérables</i>is.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Well, I for one think it's the scene
in which Jean Valjean

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,840
escapes through the Paris sewers.

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,800
- Greetings, my academic colleagues.
- Ah, you must be Percival.

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,960
- The Trobokistan ambassador's son.
- Indubitably.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,960
Oh, by the way, sir,
I always felt it would be appropriate

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,440
to discuss<i>Les Misérables</i>
in the context of a major strain

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,360
in 19th-century literature
emphasizing pauperization.

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
Hmm, an interesting theory, Percival.

74
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,320
You should do just fine
in tomorrow's quiz.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
Quiz? What quiz?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
The quiz on
the first ten chapters of<i>Les Mis.</i>

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,360
That is, for those of you
who didn't get a role in the play.

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,000
(growls)

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,200
So, do you girls want to go
to the mall tonight?

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,960
I would, but now I have a quiz
to study for.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,120
You know, ever since
somebody stole my part in the play.

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,960
- How about you, Sam?
- I have to go over my lines.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,440
You know what they say.
The more practice, the more perfect.

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,880
(sighs) I guess I'll go it alone then.

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
(all scream)

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Nice timing, Jerry.

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,600
Yeah, we were in the middle
of an important fight.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Sorry, girls.
But it's an international emergency.

89
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,120
You see, the annual Nobel Prize winners'
conference is going on today.

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,040
The world's top scholars are there.

91
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,640
International emergency?

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Sounds more like
an international snooze-fest.

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah, where can we not get tickets?

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
JERRY: As you can see on
this hotel surveillance video,

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,200
several prize winners have been
mysteriously kidnapped.

96
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,000
- They must be found.
- (groans)

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,280
Did I mention
the conference is in Paris?

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,200
ALL: Paris?!

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
And now for the gadgets.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,640
This week we have
steel cable launcher go-go boots,

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,800
jet pack backpacks,
infra-red heat-detector glasses,

102
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,960
exploding lipstick and, last but not
least, emergency propeller watches,

103
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,960
vibrant spring colors.

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,600
One more thing, tomorrow you'll be
having a surprise quiz in biology.

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,120
Two quizzes in one day?
That's totally unfair.

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,520
Unfair for some of us.

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Couldn't you at least tell us
what the quiz is on, Jer?

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,200
Sorry, but it would be
completely unethical for me

109
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,680
to disclose that the test is
covering the chapter on Cro-Magnon Man.

110
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
- Oops.
- ALL: Huh?

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh, would you look at the time?
I've really got to run.<i>Ciao.</i>

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,240
I hope this thing's on autopilot.

113
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,200
{\an8}(chatter)

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,080
- WOMAN: Vacuumed up?
- WOMAN 2: Vanished?!

115
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
MAN: But why?

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,680
OK, spies. Keep your eyes open for
anything strange and try to blend in.

117
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
Excuse me, miss.

118
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Aren't you the one who wrote the article
about the expansion of the universe?

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,200
That's me. Brains and beauty.
And yourself? What have you written?

120
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Well, my specialty is prehistoric man.

121
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,720
- In particular, Cro-Magnon.
- Can you believe it?

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,120
This guy could actually help us
on our biology quiz.

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Friends and colleagues, the specialist
on the expansion of the universe

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,840
has honored us with her presence.

125
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,640
Would you be so kind as
to share your latest findings with us?

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,080
(chuckles nervously)

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,280
OK, um, actually,
the universe is as easy as pie.

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,200
It's like... one big shopping mall.
Yeah! That's it.

129
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,320
See, it starts out small,

130
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,080
but the more business it does,
the more it expands.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,880
So, no need to worry.

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,560
By the way, did I tell you
I just love Paris?

133
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,880
(screaming)

134
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,760
- I don't see anything.
- SAM: Me neither.

135
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like she vanished into thin air.

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,320
(screaming)

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,600
What a disaster.

138
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,320
He's the foremost authority
on 19th-century French literature.

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
SAM: OK, this is officially weird.

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
Weird would be an understatement, Sammy.

141
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
Two people just got vacuumed
into the ceiling like dust bunnies.

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,960
No, not the abductions,
the people who got abducted.

143
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,760
Um, you wanna try that again in English,
Miss Cosette?

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Think about it.

145
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,440
Jerry tells us we'll be quizzed
on Cro-Magnon Man in biology tomorrow

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,920
and the Cro-Magnon specialist
gets kidnapped.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,400
We're also supposed to have a test
on<i>Les Misérables,</i>and guess what?

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,440
The expert on 19th-century
French literature vanished.

149
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,680
First of all, "we" aren't being
tested on<i>Les Misérables.</i>

150
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,040
Second of all,
do you expect us to believe

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
that there's a connection between these
kidnappings and our quizzes in LA?

152
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,920
That's exactly what I expect
you to believe, Miss Sore Loser.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
ALEX: Easy does it, girls.

154
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Look, we'll just ask Jerry for
the subject of all our upcoming quizzes,

155
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,160
and then see if any of the prize winners
are experts on those subjects.

156
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,680
<i>No way. Absolutely not.</i>

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,640
<i>I am not allowed</i>
<i>to reveal quiz subjects to you girls.</i>

158
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,680
But this is different.
It's for our mission.

159
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,840
<i>It could be a matter of life and... and</i>
<i>someone being sucked into the ceiling.</i>

160
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,680
(sighs)
Well, when you put it that way...

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,600
Your next quiz is in math class.
The topic is Isaac Newton.

162
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,240
But that's all I'm telling you.

163
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,440
Since when do we study
cookie designers in math class?

164
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,880
Newton isn't a cookie designer,
you dimwit.

165
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,640
- Who you calling a dimwit, traitor?
- (bell dings)

166
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,120
Hey, girls. There's an expert on Isaac
Newton here in the conference catalogue.

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
ALEX: He went into that restaurant.

168
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Are you two still harping on
that role in the play?

169
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,080
You obviously have never been stabbed
in the back by one of your best friends.

170
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,880
Ah-ha! I knew it. You admit
that Sam's one of your best friends.

171
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,200
ALEX: Hey, look at this.

172
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
(screams)

173
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,680
We gotta get down there.
Our expert's clearly the next in line.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,520
You're in danger!

175
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,720
(screams)

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
(screams)

177
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,760
Quick. The jet pack backpacks.

178
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Help!

179
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Incredible. The kidnappers vacuum
their victims up into these tubes.

180
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Not if we have anything to say about it.

181
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,840
Let our friend go, right now!

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,360
And tell us why you've kidnapped
the Nobel Prize winners.

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,040
(evil laughter)

184
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh, well, look at the time. Gotta fly.

185
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,680
(chuckles nervously)

186
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,400
I think you mean, "Gotta run."

187
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,960
Hey, don't leave me here!
I thought we were friends!

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
(screams)

189
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
- CLOVER: What now, Miss Bookworm?
- How should I know?

190
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,920
Well, you better think
of something fast, Cosette.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Wait, that's it. In<i>Les Misérables,</i>
Jean Valjean escapes through the sewers.

192
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
Look out!

193
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,440
Ew, nast! I'd rather fight those jerks
than go into this filthy pipe.

194
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,440
I mean, hello! My complexion is
too sensitive...

195
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
(squeals)

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh, you'll pay for this, Sam.
And I mean that literally.

197
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,320
It's gonna cost a fortune
to have my go-go boots cleaned.

198
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,160
MAN: Forget about them.
We'll just interrogate their girlfriend.

199
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,800
Good luck trying to pry
anything out of that one.

200
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,560
Oh, I can be very persuasive.

201
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,720
<i>You're lucky Sam thought of the sewers.</i>

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>you would've been French toast.</i>

203
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,960
<i>Wait a second. I'm getting</i>
<i>a weak signal from Alex's compowder.</i>

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,160
<i>I'll patch it through.</i>

205
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,160
<i>Help! What are you two waiting for,</i>
<i>an invitation?</i>

206
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm locking in on her location.

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,440
<i>Oh, my. It appears she's being held</i>
<i>at 12118 Marmalade Street.</i>

208
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,320
- But that's...
- The house next door to mine.

209
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,720
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>And according to WOOHP records,</i>

210
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
<i>that's where the ambassador from</i>
<i>Trobokistan and his son</i>

211
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
<i>have been living.</i>

212
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,800
Isn't that the fat-headed kid
from Mr Tetley's class?

213
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,280
Yeah. We'd better get back
to Beverly Hills.

214
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,800
CLOVER: Farewell, gay Paris.

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,360
MAN: I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where's WOOHP headquarters?

216
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,400
I wouldn't tell you in a million years,
chump.

217
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,520
Just you wait and see what I do to you
when I get out of here.

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,680
OK, you wanna play games? Fine.
I got a game for you.

219
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,920
(screams)

220
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,720
(drilling)

221
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,280
It's about time you two got here!

222
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,400
- I warned you not to mess with me.
- (growls)

223
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,800
(screams)

224
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
Not bad for a bookworm.

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,040
- Now let's find the prize winners.
- (door opening)

226
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,880
<i>We've got all three of them, boss.</i>

227
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,560
Good. Bring 'em in.

228
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,440
Hey, it's the big-head freak
from our school.

229
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,960
Pi R-squared times
logarithm of ZY equals...

230
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,400
It's like they're sucking
the intelligence from the prize winners

231
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,960
and putting it into his head.

232
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,080
No wonder he's such a know-it-all.

233
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,760
ALL: Mr Ambassador.

234
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,600
ALL: Ambassador?

235
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,280
That's right, girls.

236
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,760
And also soon the father of
the most intelligent child in the world.

237
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,120
My son will be a genius in no time.
A star pupil in school.

238
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,800
No one will dare pick on him
the way they picked on me.

239
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,640
So, let me get this straight.

240
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,240
You kidnapped scholars
to suck out their brains

241
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,160
and pump them into your son's head?

242
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,360
- Yes.
- And you think he won't get picked on?

243
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,560
Hello, the guy's head is
the size of a hot-air balloon.

244
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,560
(girls laugh)

245
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,680
We'll see who gets the last laugh.

246
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,920
- He's gonna turn us into hamsters!
- Keen observation.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,160
The hamster is really going to benefit
from your intelligence.

248
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,320
(girls scream)

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,880
- Hey, Alex, do that again.
- No way! It hurts!

250
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,120
If you keep it up,
you might break through.

251
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
(alarm blares)

252
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,480
That was close.

253
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,480
- Another job well done, girls.
- ALL: Thanks, Jerry.

254
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,960
Wait a minute. Couldn't you have
broken out of your cylinders yourselves?

255
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,560
- You both have propeller watches.
- Um, yeah, I suppose.

256
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,640
(scoffs) Yeah, and risk getting
unsightly facial bruises?

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I don't think so.

258
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,640
Um, girls? Aren't you forgetting
something important?

259
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,440
(screams)

260
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
(strains)

261
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,520
That is one freak show
I want no part of.

262
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,360
Hey, what do you know? It's working!

263
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,920
Nice job, Alex. You saved the world.

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,360
Guess this means from now on he'll have
to study for tests like the rest of us.

265
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,880
Oh, wait. I forgot.
Some of us are exempt from tests.

266
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,560
(squeals)

267
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Lucky thing there was almost
no fluid left in the tube.

268
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
You alright, girls?

269
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,040
A little grossed out,
but otherwise fine.

270
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,200
I can't... I can't believe
you just did that for me.

271
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,640
You totally saved my life, Sam.
Not to mention my outfit.

272
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,440
Well, I wouldn't have done it
for just anybody.

273
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,520
- Only for a best friend?
- Exactly.

274
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
Oh, Sammy! I'm so sorry
I called you a thief and a traitor!

275
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,440
No, I should be sorry. I never should
have accepted the role of Cosette.

276
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,920
(gasps) Oh, no! It's time for
our quiz on<i>Les Misérables!</i>

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No!

278
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,960
CLOVER: Quick, to Beverly High!

279
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,240
I forgot all about it! Heck, I don't
know squat about<i>Les Misérables.</i>

280
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
Neither do I.

281
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
BOTH: What are we gonna do?!

282
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,840
Don't worry about it, girls. I'll tell
you everything you need to know.

283
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,400
After all,
that's what best friends are for.

284
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,320
Good. Cos we also need help cramming
for our biology quiz on the Cro-Mags.

285
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,680
Hmm...

286
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,400
Wow. Who knew an artist like me
could also excel at academics?

287
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,760
Looks like we're all multi-talented.

288
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,400
Speaking of which, what did you guys
decide to do about the play?

289
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,200
It's simple.
I'm going to convince Mr Tetley

290
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,120
that Clover is the right actress
for the part of Cosette.

291
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
And I'm going to insist that
he make Sam my first understudy.

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,840
Mr Tetley,
we need to talk to you right away.

293
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,200
- Yeah, it's about the part of Cosette.
- Shh. Not now, girls.

294
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
MANDY: Oh, Monsieur Valjean.

295
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,720
What ill fortune to be poor
with no family.

296
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
That's it! That was brilliant, Mandy.

297
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,880
You were born to play Cosette,
and I won't take no for an answer.

298
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,080
BOTH: Huh?

299
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,120
Mandy, you've got
the makings of a star!

300
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
Tell me something I don't know.

301
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,920
That thief!

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,040
- CLOVER: That traitor!
- SAM: That back-stabber!

303
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,040
Here we go again.
