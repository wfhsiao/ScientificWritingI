- (bell rings)
- Fire!

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,800
(imitates sirens)
Fire! Fire!

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,480
{\an8}(school bell ringing)

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,640
{\an8}- SAM: No way.
- CLOVER: Way.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
{\an8}- SAM: So then what'd you do?
- CLOVER: The only thing I could.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,160
{\an8}- SAM: No way.
- Way!

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,040
- You're so cool.
- (horn blares)

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,320
(Clover gasps)

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
Wow.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,480
ALEX: What is it, Clover?

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,880
- Yeah, are you OK?
- I'm more than OK.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,280
- I'm in love.
- Ew! Caitlin's brother?

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,880
We really have to get her a blindfold.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,720
Why hello, Rick. So good to see you.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Hey, Clover.

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,080
How would you love
to give me a ride home?

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,120
Ah, I can't. Gotta go to the mall.
Nice skirt. Where'd you get that?

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,480
- (giggles)
- I gotta get my kid sister a present.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,120
CLOVER: Kid sister?

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,320
I bet his kid sister
wouldn't wear something like this.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,880
My mom wouldn't wear
something like that.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,720
Maybe you should just be yourself,
Clover.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,440
Be myself? Hello?! Rick's a senior.
As in, he's used to sophisticated women.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah, but if a person doesn't like you
for who you are...

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,840
You guys, we're in the spy business.
Reinventing ourselves is what we do.

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,160
(all gasp)

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
(all scream)

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
(all grunt)

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Girls, we have
a worldwide problem on our hands.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,800
Vital members of society
have stopped doing their jobs.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
They're only interested
in playing with toys.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,640
- ALEX: Toys?
- You're kidding, right?

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,880
- Unfortunately, I'm quite serious.
- Whoa.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,600
This chaos will turn into pandemonium
unless we nip it in the bud.

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
And so, your mission is
to go undercover as buyers.

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Finally. A mission I can relate to.

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
As we speak,
there's a toy fair in Taiwan.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
Perhaps you can find a clue there as
to who's behind this bizarre phenomenon.

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,160
I've assembled some gadgets for you.
There's the Magne-Belt.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah, that's a little too Elvis for me.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,360
The TAD, or Tracking Accessory Device.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,680
It can be activated by your compowders.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,920
Infrared heat detector glasses.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,360
The manicure kit with press-on
sticky fingers and laser nail file.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,760
Ooh, does it have
cherry blossom red in it?

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,600
- And electric blue.
- Perfect.

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
(shrieks)

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,480
And lastly, the ejector bead bracelet.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,120
Careful with that one.
It's still in development.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,480
By the way,
I like your new look, Clover.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Very sophisticated.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,840
- My mother has a suit just like it.
- (girls snigger)

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
GIRLS: Huh?
(all scream)

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
ALL: Cool!

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,680
Look at all the toys. How...

67
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,320
- Awesome.
- Cool.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,640
..childish.

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,800
WOMAN: Did you see how wonderful
the Vladimir Kozyrev Line was?

70
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,400
WOMAN 2: You have to see
that Vladimir line.

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,600
MAN: Vladimir Kozyrev is
the most popular at the convention.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Guess we know where to start.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
ALL: Cool!

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,960
I'd say we're definitely
in the right place.

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,280
Welcome to the Vladimir Kozyrev Booth.

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,960
Thanks. We hear your toys
are all the rage.

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,160
What my associate means
to articulate is,

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
is that we've, uh, observed
a positive reaction to your toy line.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Yeah, they're all the rage.

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,120
I've never heard of
Vladimir Kozyrev before.

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,160
- Are his toys in stores yet?
- No. We're a brand-new company.

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,040
Really? No one's had a chance
to play with them?

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,840
REP: This is our big debut.

84
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,760
I see.

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Why don't you take some toys?

86
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,600
- Hey!
- Go on. Open them.

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,400
You'll see their appeal instantly.
Really.

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,920
Maybe later. Right now
we need to make a phone call.

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,120
JERRY:<i>Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>How's the toy fair?</i>

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,920
We're sending samples your way
from the Vladimir Kozyrev Toy Company.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
<i>Ow!</i>

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,480
The rep said the company's brand new,
but the packaging's ancient.

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,520
Like from the Seventies.

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
Not only that, all the toys in the WOOHP
playback were from their toy line.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,120
<i>Good work, girls.</i>
<i>I'll let you know what we find out.</i>

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Let's go over the mission
while we wait to hear from Jerry.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,040
Better yet, let's go over
how I'm going to impress Rick

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,040
while we're stuck in stupid Taiwan.

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,960
Taiwan's not stupid, Clover.
It's exotic and interesting.

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Good angle. Why didn't I think of that?

101
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,480
(compowder ringing)

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,080
Hi, Rick. It's Clover.

103
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,720
Oh, nothing much. I'm just calling
from exotic and interesting Taiwan.

104
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,080
- (beeping)
- That was fast.

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,200
Huh? Jerry says there's no record of
a Vladimir Kozyrev company anywhere.

106
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,160
Well, somebody has to be
making these toys.

107
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
Sam? Are you OK?

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,120
- (chuckles)
- (gasps)

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
(laughs)

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,600
Rick, I'm gonna have to call you back.

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,400
- This is so sixth grade.
- Yeah, Sammy. Cut it out.

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,080
- Make me.
- (growls)

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,440
Leave me alone! No!

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,760
Do something, Clover.
Make her stop acting like a kid.

115
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,160
- What do I look like, her mother?
- Well, in that outfit...

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
(grunts in frustration)

117
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,640
You behave,
or you're going to your room.

118
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,080
- Huh?
- (sighs)

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,560
ALEX:
We better tell Jerry what's going on.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,040
- Hi, Jerry.
-<i>Look, everyone. It's Clover.</i>

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>Red Rover, Red Rover, send Clover over.</i>

122
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,640
(all laugh)

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
(both shriek)

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,320
Oh, no. Not Jerry too!

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,800
We have to figure out
what's up with these toys

126
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,000
before Jerry and Sam and everyone
are stuck like this forever.

127
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,680
(whispers) It's just the same old stuff
we saw when we were here before.

128
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,160
The Barkaroo!

129
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
Shh!

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,720
Ooh, Megatronic-action hero!

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,960
Shh!

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,440
- The Beauty Queen! Yeah!
- Shh!

133
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,720
(gasps)

134
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
It's Mommy's doll.
They have Mommy's doll!

135
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Hey, my mom had one of those, too.
The Little Ann.

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,400
She said it was the hottest thing
when she was a kid.

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,520
Why? It doesn't even light up.

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Let's see who manufactured this baby.

139
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
The Little Ann...

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
- (girls gasp)
- MAN: Hey!

141
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Run!

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,240
Trespassers are headed for the alley.
Get rid of them. Permanently.

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't think
that's a welcoming committee.

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
(horns blaring)

145
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,880
(sirens blaring)

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,440
Jerry was right!
Chaos is turning into pandemonium!

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,080
Time for a manicure.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,920
Do you really think there's time?
Cos that electric blue is awesome.

149
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
- Press-on sticky fingers.
- Right.

150
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
SAM: Whee!

151
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
(compowder ringing)

152
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
That must be the info
on the Little Ann doll.

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
Says it was manufactured by The Little
Ann Toy Company in Russia in '74.

154
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
They stopped production
a few years later.

155
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Didn't you say the packaging
on the Vladimir Kozyrev line

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
was from the Seventies?

157
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
See who owned
the Little Ann Toy Company.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,760
Vladimir Kozyrev?!
Of course, they're one and the same.

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
He's still using his old factory
to make these new toys.

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
Guess we know where we're headed.

161
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,280
(dog barking)

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
A lot of security for a toy factory.

163
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
We need to get inside.

164
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,760
- Oh, look! I want one.
- Shh!

165
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,520
BOTH: Yeah!

166
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,600
- What's that?
- (both scream)

167
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,000
Sam, stop! Sam!

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,520
Simon didn't say!

169
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,760
Simon says stop, Sam.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,040
- (alarm wails)
<i>- Intruder alert!</i>

171
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,720
Who put these here?
They're for the next shipment.

172
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
Rodney, help me get these inside.

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,440
- There's a malfunction in this doll.
- Trash it.

174
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
MAN: Grab another two
for the next shipment.

175
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
(screams)

176
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,120
BOTH: Yeah!

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,520
CLOVER: The TAD says Sam's in here.

178
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,280
This is almost as big as your closet.

179
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,520
Sam, quick! Get out of there!

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,440
Simon says, "Get out of there now, Sam!"

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,760
(laughs)

182
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,200
That was fun. What else can we play?

183
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
(Alex and Clover sigh)

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
I wonder why they don't close the boxes.

185
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll go ask.

186
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I have a better idea.
Let's play I Spy.

187
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,120
- Like we don't do that every day.
- Yeah!

188
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Me first, me first!

189
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,200
I spy with my little eye
something that is...

190
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
..big.

191
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,120
- A computer.
- You're good.

192
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,160
I bet that beam has something to do
with everyone acting like kids.

193
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,960
We just have to figure out what
the computer chip is and reprogram it.

194
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
I can't log on.

195
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,280
Password's usually obvious cos they
think no one will go for the obvious.

196
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
Like... toys.

197
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Huh? OK, Little Ann?

198
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Obviously he doesn't know the rules.

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
Now what?

200
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
BOTH: Huh?

201
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
Works for me.

202
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,880
At least it'll slow 'em down
while we...

203
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,880
- MAN: Intruders!
- (girls shriek)

204
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
Take that!

205
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Run!

206
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,680
Last one out is a rotten egg!

207
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
(all gasp)

208
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,880
How lovely.

209
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,400
- What are you thinking?
- Revenge, of course.

210
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,640
Children who once adored my Little Ann
have grown up and forgotten the joy.

211
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,880
The simplicity.

212
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,320
They're only interested in high-tech
gizmos and silly electronic toys.

213
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,640
Uh, dude, I think
she was talking about the outfit.

214
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,400
Totally.
Now, about this whole "revenge thing."

215
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
- It won't bring back the Little Ann.
- Of course it will.

216
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,720
Adults across the world will be forced
to remember the joy of the Little Ann

217
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,240
as soon as I regress them
to the children they once were.

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, please, oh, please,
can I go with you?

219
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,840
Please?!

220
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
Now, why can't you have
an attitude like that?

221
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Hop aboard, my little elf.

222
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,280
No, Sam! Simon says, "No."

223
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,480
You'll never get away with this!

224
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
On second thought, maybe he will.

225
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,480
Once those beams hit us,
we're doomed to a life of immaturity.

226
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,160
Rick will never know the joy of me!

227
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,280
- Hey, it's not my fault.
- Push me!

228
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,480
Where'd they go?

229
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,480
(screams)

230
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,680
(laughs)

231
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,520
Hey, little boy. I'll give you
a lollipop if you untie me.

232
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,560
Oh, OK.

233
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,960
- No sign of Vladimir's sleigh.
- The TAD!

234
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,440
Sam's just ahead of us.

235
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
- (both gasp)
- He threw her overboard!

236
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,400
We gotta catch her!
Hang on for hyper-speed.

237
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,920
(girls scream)

238
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,200
He tricked us. It's just a doll.

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,120
- Look!
- (screaming)

240
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,760
ALEX: Kozyrev's dolls aren't
turning people into kids anymore.

241
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,120
Now he's using them as an evil army.

242
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
We're too late.

243
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
Maybe not. What does Vladimir care
about most in the world?

244
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,320
- Bellbottoms?
- The Little Ann.

245
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,440
His pride and joy.
We've gotta beat him at his own game.

246
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh!

247
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,120
- I don't get it.
- The old switcheroo.

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
Don't you mean Barkaroo?

249
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Try to stay with me.

250
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,920
We put the computer chip from
the Barkaroo into the Little Ann.

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
It's so obvious
he'll never suspect a thing.

252
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Yeah!

253
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,440
I'm on!

254
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,000
- Ow!
- (gasps)

255
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,240
Hey, don't be mean!

256
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,320
- My Little Ann!
- This is the last one, Vladi.

257
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,240
If you throw me over, she goes, too.

258
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,120
(grunts)

259
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,920
My Little Ann.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,720
What do you want to do today,
Little Ann?

261
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,360
Vladimir, you have to go back to
the factory and make things right.

262
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
I don't want to. I want to play.

263
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,440
You do it right now, mister,
or you're grounded.

264
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
<i>♪ Vladimir's in trouble ♪</i>

265
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,760
Alright.

266
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
(bell rings)

267
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,440
- SAM: No way.
- ALEX: Way.

268
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,400
Clover, did I really act like a kid?

269
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
Only slightly more than usual.

270
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,400
Hi, Rick.
I have two tickets to the opera.

271
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,000
- Would you care to join me?
- Opera?

272
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,800
Clover, what happened?
You look like my mom now.

273
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,280
Hey, Rick. Are we still going
to the street fair tonight?

274
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
Sure, Mandy.

275
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,840
Nice outfit. PTA meeting?
(cackles)

276
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,360
(growls)

277
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Excuse me, professor? Could you tell me
where the administration office is?

278
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
(growls)

279
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,360
(screams)

280
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Being mature is so over-rated.
