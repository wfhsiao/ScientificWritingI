Hey, Toby, put that fantasy junk away!

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, how about the reality of
getting the chores done before sunup?

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,400
But this is the best part.
The aliens are about to land!

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh, my!

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,560
ALL: Whoa!

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,120
{\an8}DRIVING INSTRUCTOR:
Left! Straighten out! Right! Look out!

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,040
{\an8}I seriously suggest you get yourself
a bus schedule, young lady,

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,600
because at this rate, there's no way
you'll pass your driving test!

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
{\an8}ALEX: But I've got to pass!

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,520
Girls who drive attract three times more
boys than girls who don't!

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,120
Don't worry, Alex! We know
you'll come through in the clutch!

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Please... don't say "clutch!"

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,840
ALL: Huh?

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,520
(they scream)

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,800
You're the one taking driver's ed, Alex!
Where are the brakes!?

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,880
Is this WOOHP? I can't see anything.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,160
I should've bought that glow-in-the-dark
tank top at the mall.

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,360
Have I mentioned I don't like the dark?
I'm not scared. You never know what's...

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,040
- (they scream)
- Hello, girls.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,800
Jerry!
You know what stress does to my skin!

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,040
Sorry. Agent Morrison tripped over
the generator cable again.

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Now, take a look at these satellite
tapes from Italy, Russia and France.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,120
WOOHP has reason to believe the people
in these videos were abducted by aliens.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
(they laugh)

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Aliens? You're kidding, right?

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,080
Did you bonk your head
in the shower this morning?

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,240
This is serious, spies. These abductions
occurred in the last two weeks.

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
The first one was in
this Iowa cornfield.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,360
Your mission is to visit
the abduction site and look for clues.

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,920
I knew we couldn't be alone
in the galaxy!

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,040
I knew there was life on other planets!

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
Hey, Alex, you sound like
you're from another planet!

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah, Planet What-ever!

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Your equipment will include
some old favorites:

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,120
Jet-Pack Backpacks;
Hair-Pick Lock Picks;

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Heat Sensor 6000
Infrared Motion-Detector Sunglasses,

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
now with wireless internet connections
and digital camera functions.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Some new items:
Wrist-Mounted Grapplo-XGs; and CLALG.

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,160
Ew. Need a glass of water, Jerry?

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,920
That's "CLALG." C-L-A-L-G.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Combination Laser And Lip Gloss.
In fruity low-cal bubble gum flavor.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,120
If there are aliens out there, we'll
show them the best Earth has to offer.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
BOTH: Yay, Earth!

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,560
Goodbye, and good luck, ladies.

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
(they scream)

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,680
PILOT:<i> This is your WOOHP pilot. We're</i>
<i>flying over the Midwest at 37,000 feet.</i>

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,680
<i>If you'll look out the bottom</i>
<i>of the plane, you'll see Iowa.</i>

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,120
Bottom of the plane?

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,160
(they scream)

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,440
(they shriek)

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
Looks like it doesn't matter if she's
driving a car or flying a jetpack.

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
Alex still can't steer!

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
SAM: I hope she sees that...

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
...water tower.

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
(compowder alert)

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,880
<i>Clover, Sam, can you read me?</i>

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,920
We're in the cornfield.
It's like a maze!

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,640
<i>Oh, yeah. I can see you.</i>

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Hello!

69
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640
The corn's been cut in
some kind of pattern.

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,760
It looks like a giant sandal!

71
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm sending a picture of this
back to WOOHP!

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
(screams)

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,280
We're not coming back from this mission
with aliens,

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
just with corn dust in our hair!

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,000
Just a tip? Don't try that move
during your driver's test.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Right...

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
- Who's there?
- I don't like this...

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840
Me neither!

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
(they grunt)

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
We didn't mean to scare you!
I'm Toby, and this is Jed.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,520
Talk about out of this world!

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm Sam, and this is Alex and
Clover. We're... corn inspectors.

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Were you here the night
there were all those lights?

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,400
We sure were! Our buddy Caleb
got picked right up into a spaceship!

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,520
We've been looking for him ever since.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,240
- What did the spaceship look like?
- It looked like a kumquat.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,320
- Naw, more like a big ol' rutabaga!
- Aw, you've got hog slop in your eyes!

88
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,520
Do you guys take snack breaks out here?

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,560
No, the nearest burger place
is 40 miles away.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,520
Then either there were other humans
here the night Caleb got snatched

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
or the aliens went through
the drive-thru

92
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,920
- before getting down to business!
- (helicopter whirrs)

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,960
- Hasn't my hair suffered enough!?
- Maybe the aliens have come back!

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,920
- BOTH: Huh?
- You girls better check that out.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm gonna stay here and, you know,
protect the corn.

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,960
- Someone should protect them from you!
- (laughs)

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?

98
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,280
We're relatives of the people
who've disappeared.

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,840
We're trying to figure out
what's going on.

100
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,520
Ah. Well, I'm Dr. Sagan Hawking.
I'm an astronomer.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Cool! I'm a Virgo!

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,320
I'm studying the abductions as well.
If we're facing an alien invasion,

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
I want to know just
what we're up against.

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,840
Anything you've learned
might be helpful.

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Oh, we'd love to help.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Well, then hop in. I'll fly you to
my little workshop in the Rockies.

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
(beeping)

108
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,880
Awesome! Everything in this place
has to do with researching aliens!

109
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,800
"Awesome," or "completely insane?"
You make the call.

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,520
SAGAN: This way, girls!

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,720
- Hey, what does "GOOPER"...
- I'll take those. Thank you.

112
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
Now, if you will direct
your attention to the table.

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
The stars indicate where
the abductions have taken place.

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,040
My theory is that aliens are capturing
members of different cultures

115
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,440
and studying them so they can decide
where to start the full invasion.

116
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,120
There are a lot of countries
they haven't hit yet.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I hope they won't "visit" Beverly Hills.

118
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,520
And my computers are predicting
the next abduction will take place here

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,120
in a bazaar in Saudi Arabia.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,360
- Thanks for your time, Doctor.
- Wait!

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,360
You promised you'd tell me
what you've learned, remember?

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,000
We've learned the alien ship may look
like a kumquat. Or a rutabaga.

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,200
I see. Well, I trust you'll contact me
if you find out anything else.

124
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,120
And I'll do the same for you,
of course.

125
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,160
Time to "sheik" our booties
to Saudi Arabia!

126
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,280
{\an8}Oh, this is my kind of mission.
Undercover in bargain city!

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Hello! Focus. you never know
what might be around the next...

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,520
ALEX: I think they're not here
for the sales!

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,120
Now that's what I call
falling for a girl!

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,560
(they gasp)

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Nice meeting you guys, but I gotta go.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
See ya!

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't care how good the deals are
here. Next time, I shop online!

134
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
Nobody touches my hair!

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,080
I could swear I saw that in a movie!

136
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,880
- Just remember driver's ed.
- (horn beeps)

137
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Plan ahead when steering,
identify hazards, signal turns...

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
...and never, ever tailgate.

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,720
- You alright, Alex?
- Totally.

140
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,000
But these guys knew we were gonna
be here! Like, we were set up!

141
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,720
"GOOPER" again!
And look at that burger bag.

142
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
Just like the one Clover
found back in Iowa!

143
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Something tells me
Dr. Hawking is connected.

144
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
<i>Afternoon, ladies.</i>

145
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Hey, Jerry, does the name "GOOPER"
mean anything to you?

146
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,920
Sorry, it doesn't, but I'll check on it.
However, I do have some information

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,280
about the pattern you found in
the cornfield.

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,400
<i>- Is it an alien message?</i>
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

149
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,320
<i>The shapes represent numbers. They're</i>
<i>latitude and longitude coordinates</i>

150
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,320
<i>for an isolated mesa in Mexico.</i>

151
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,200
<i>You'll fly there in this new WOOHP</i>
<i>transportation prototype.</i>

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,400
<i>- I'm sure you will love it.</i>
<i>-</i> ALL: Cool!

153
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
(they scream)

154
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Iowa, Colorado, Saudi Arabia, Mexico...

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,920
I wish we got frequent flyer miles
for all the places we go!

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Tell me about it! If there were aliens,
we could go visit them on their planet.

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080
ALL: Huh?

158
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
ALEX: Look!

159
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,560
- Aliens! For real!
- BOTH: Maybe...

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,880
Cover me! I'm checking this out!

161
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,720
Cover her?
Against the Starship Enormo-prise!?

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,920
We can't let her go alone! Come on!

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
- Got a plan yet?
- I was hoping maybe you did.

164
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Just a second, we're talking.

165
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
(they gasp)

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,880
Well, here I am. Now what?

167
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,520
Whoa... OK... no presh, Alex,

168
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,920
just the first communication
between our two planets...

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280
Um... hey... what's up?

170
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,520
- Excuse me?
- Did you just speak English?

171
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Actually, I'm better with French,
but I'm pretty good in English

172
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
and more than 25 other
intergalactic dialects.

173
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
(they scream)

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,920
ALEX:
Why have you been abducting people?

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,480
We've never done that! It's the GOOPERs!

176
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
You know about GOOPER?

177
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,840
There was a distress message
from our friends in the wheat field

178
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,200
saying they'd been captured
by evil GOOPERs.

179
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,760
We came as quickly as we could,
but the GOOPERs were waiting for us!

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,960
I must let my friends
know what's going on.

181
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,920
- (static)
- Great. It's jammed!

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,720
Clover and Sam. I'm trapped in an alien
ship. Hope you can track me.

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
Come quick. Love, Alex.

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,320
So, tell me more about the GOOPERs.
Are they evil aliens?

185
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
SAGAN: Not quite.

186
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,000
Dr. Hawking! Have the GOOPERs
captured you, too?

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,320
Captured me? They're working for me!
And you, little spy, are my prisoner!

188
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,320
- But we told you we're just...
- That's right. Concerned relatives?

189
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,120
Please. I saw you land your jetpacks
in that cornfield.

190
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,280
I made up that whole "astronomer" story
to find out how much you knew!

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,720
- So... who are you?
- I am the leader of GOOPER!

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,720
- Whoa, I had the freakiest dream.
- Me, too. Thank goodness it's over.

193
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,440
(they gasp)

194
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't be afraid! We won't hurt you!

195
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Finally!
Someone who doesn't want to hurt us!

196
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,920
Wait... did you just speak English?
Freaky.

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,880
- Cool. But, yeah... freaky.
- It's Alex.

198
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,760
ALEX:<i> I'm trapped in an alien ship.</i>
<i>Hope you can track me.</i>

199
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,120
<i>- Come quick. Love, Alex.</i>
<i>-</i> She's trapped on that ship.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,920
The GOOPERs got her!
Just like they got our friend!

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,920
Why would they do this?
We would never hurt anyone!

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,960
GOOPERs, huh? Sounds like we've all got
a reason to get to that big spaceship!

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,920
But how are the four of us gonna follow
Alex with just two Jet-Pack Backpacks?

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Leave that to us.

205
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,200
All right, just what is "GOOPER" anyway?

206
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,520
"Global Organization Of Pilfering
Extraterrestrial Resources!"

207
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,680
I tracked this ship over Iowa,
then jammed its equipment.

208
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,240
Now this ship and its crew work for me!

209
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,120
And thanks to the "distress" message
we left in that cornfield,

210
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,640
- I have two ships to aid in my plan!
- What plan?

211
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,400
To create fear! And when Earth is
completely terrified of an invasion,

212
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll force the aliens to make "their"
demands: the abductions will only stop

213
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,120
if the world's governments
hand over all their wealth!

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,120
What happens to the people
you've already abducted?

215
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, yes, that is a situation.
They'll have to be "disposed of."

216
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
In fact, you'll be the first
to test my Obliterator!

217
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,280
Report to me when you're finished.
I'll be in the control room.

218
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
(yells)

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,080
SAM: Wow! You gave our sky skimmer
a major upgrade.

220
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,520
ALIEN: And it has tracking equipment,
so we can find our friends!

221
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,120
Like, how do you know
how to do all this?

222
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,080
Back on our home planet,
we're an elite team of spies! Let's go!

223
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,080
Dress me up in veils, huh?
Well, look who's laughing now!

224
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,320
- That would be me!
- (gasps / yells)

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,280
That won't stop them for long! Come on!

226
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
Get 'em!

227
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,440
- ALIEN: How will we get inside?
- We'll just walk in the door!

228
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
ALIEN: What door?

229
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
- Ha ha!
- That door!

230
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,040
ALEX: That must be the Obliterator!

231
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,600
CALEB: No! Let me go! Help! Help!

232
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,640
Look, that must be Caleb, the guy
who was abducted from the corn field.

233
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,320
ALIEN: They're going to use it
on those people.

234
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,120
Not if we can help it. But how can
the two of us stop all those goons?

235
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,560
GOON: Not to mention us!
There's nowhere to run...

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,200
OK, I'm ready to be rescued now.

237
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,920
Are we glad to see you!
Dr. Hawking's behind all this.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,360
I'd tell you more,
but we still have company!

239
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,080
Now it's our turn to help you!

240
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,920
Neat toy! Where did you get it?

241
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
From our spy supervisor, J'Ree.

242
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
- Jerry?
- No, J'Ree.

243
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,000
- CALEB: Help!
- Up and over, girls!

244
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,360
You guys free the aliens. I'm going
for that big, nasty thingamajig.

245
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,760
Let's see... pulse magnitude,
strength indicator...

246
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,920
Here it is! "Off!"

247
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,720
- ALIENS:<i> Merci beaucoup!</i>
- They speak French too?

248
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,120
And more than 25 other
intergalactic dialects.

249
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,760
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

250
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,920
Why don't these things
come with an "off" switch?

251
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,960
You again?

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Sorry, I just had my hair cut!

253
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,080
Dr. Hawking's in the control room!

254
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
Don't touch another button!

255
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,960
Get them!

256
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
(they struggle)

257
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,560
Give it up, Doctor!
Hurry up, girls. She just programmed...

258
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
Stay back! Or I'll crash
this ship into Mexico City!

259
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
If I can't have this technology,
no one can!

260
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, you definitely can't have it.

261
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,320
ALL: Whoa!

262
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,680
- We're going down!
- Tell us something we don't know!

263
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,360
- Steer us clear of the city!
- Me? Steer?

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
There's no one else, Alex!

265
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,720
Wait a minute!
These controls look kind of familiar.

266
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,320
It's almost exactly like the car
from my driver's ed class, I think!

267
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,120
- Then start driving!
- Maybe if I do this...?

268
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
(they scream)

269
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,480
(shrieks) I can't keep her up anymore!
I've got to set her down!

270
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,720
There's just enough room there...
I'm gonna park it like a pro!

271
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,680
(they yell)

272
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,120
(indicators beep)

273
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,280
- Excuse me! Driving is hard enough!
- You got it?

274
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,320
Please return your seats to their
upright positions, we have landed!

275
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040
I sure hope I'll pass
my driving test after that!

276
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,880
If you ever need your corn inspected,
um, here's my number...

277
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,440
ALEX: Bye, guys! Have a safe flight!

278
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
ALIEN:<i> Merci beaucoup!</i>

279
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,240
Maybe someday we can visit them
on their planet.

280
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Maybe. But right now,
you've got a test to take!

281
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
(they laugh)

282
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,320
I've never seen a student make such
quick progress! How did you do it, Alex?

283
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I practiced on a giant alien spaceship.

284
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,240
- So, where do you want to drive first?
- Definitely the mall!

285
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,920
I want to see if I can attract three
times as many boys now that I can drive!

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,080
(crash)

287
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,560
(cries)

288
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
(they laugh)

289
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Ah, man, I guess I still need
to practice with the parking brake!
