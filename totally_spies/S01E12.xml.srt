Dad, this is so boring. It's just a rock
with a bunch of dead guys on it.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,920
Come on son, one more picture.
Now smile.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,880
(surprised cries)

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,040
What's wrong, Clover? Did you,
like, hurt yourself or something?

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,480
No, I'm fine.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,760
Then what's with the lame rollerblading?

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,280
(gasps)

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,920
Whoa!

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,800
Watch and learn, ladies!

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,600
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,840
- Wow, she's good.
- Very good.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Sure, Saturday night would be perfect,
Jason.

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Cool. I'll pick you up at eight.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,520
Did you see that?
I just got a date with Jason Roberts.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,920
Mandy's going to so hate me. She's been
wanting to go out with him for like...

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,840
(they scream)

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,800
Whoa! Whoa!

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,920
- Oh, sorry, Jerry.
- (sighs)

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,840
No problem. That was just
the million-dollar prototype

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,600
for our new billion-dollar
surveillance satellite.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,920
Spies, I've got
an important assignment for you.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,080
Famous landmarks from around
the world are being stolen.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,880
How does someone steal a landmark?

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,920
Aren't they big and kind of...
connected to the ground?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Well, our perpetrator has found
a way to shrink them,

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,720
then suck them up into the sky.
We've acquired some video

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,520
taken by tourists
who have witnessed these events.

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,000
Huh? Oops.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Now, it seems this thief
is moving from west to east,

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,520
so according to WOOHP calculations,
the Taj Mahal is the next target.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,960
- Cool! We get to go to Mexico!
- Uh, India.

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,120
Yes.
And you will be posing as diplomats.

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,000
Here are your papers, credentials
and native costumes.

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,960
- Now, for your gadgets...
- Wow.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Today's specials include an all-in-one
lipstick and titanium Extendo-Rod...

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Ugh! I look horrible in pinks.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,920
A locator/deactivator
rhinestone headband,

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,520
turbo-fueled jet-pack backpacks,

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,640
telescopic Optic 2000 sunglasses
with built-in cam,

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,840
a laser cutter eyelash curler,
and a CADBOP.

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,000
Is that one of those
fruit-flavored snacks?

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,960
No, it's a Climb-Anything Dirt Bike
that's Octane-Powered.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,520
Uh, one thing, Jer. How long
do you think this mission will take?

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,320
I can't be sure, actually.

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
As long as it takes for you to find
and stop whoever is behind this.

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,360
Well, you see,
I've got this date Saturday night,

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,880
so, it would be better for me if we
could just be back by then!

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,720
Wow, that is amazing!

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,200
It's even bigger than some of
the houses in Beverly Hills.

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
I don't understand why you had
to lug all your clothes with you.

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
Fashion crisis! I need to pick out
what to wear on my date.

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
Number one rule in dating:
the outfit is everything!

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,200
Wait, isn't that
the number one rule in life?

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,920
Uh-oh. It seems like Jerry
overlooked one little detail.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
How are we going to get in?

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,160
We're diplomats, remember?
We have papers and credentials.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,360
We're closed for renovations.
No one gets in!

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,600
- What do we do, now?
- I'm thinking...

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,560
Four days till Jason.
Can ya think a little faster?

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah! Who's up for climbing?

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,520
- How do girls move in these things?
- Don't worry. I can fix this.

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,680
You know,
since short is last year's long,

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm thinking we market these things
and make a killing.

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
Alright, you guys.
Let's do what we do best.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Cool. Point me toward the gift shop!

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
Place looks clean.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,240
I'm telling Jerry
that WOOHP's calculations are wrong.

78
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,240
Wait, what's this?

79
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,920
CLOVER: It's either a tracking device
or a way-cool mood ring.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
- SAM: Let me see.
- (they shriek)

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,200
Look out! The walls are closing in!

82
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,800
So's the ceiling!
We're going to get squashed!

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,240
Quick, the door!

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,320
- ALEX: It's locked!
- SAM: Over here!

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
ALEX: We're not gonna make it through!

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
Wait! The all-in-one lipstick and
titanium Extendo-Rod should work!

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,720
I think it's time we called Jerry.

88
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,760
Uh, Jer, the Taj Mahal kind of... got
away from us, if you know what we mean.

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,920
But we recovered this tracking device.
And to catch whoever is behind this,

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,720
we need you to see if its frequency
matches any other tracking devices

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,080
- elsewhere in the world.
- Let's see... Ah-ha.

93
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,120
<i>Yes, yes... I'm picking up</i>
<i>a faint signal near the Great Wall.</i>

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,360
- Looks like we're Peru bound.
- Uh, try China.

95
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
Hmph!

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,000
I wish it could help me find
an outfit for my date.

97
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,520
SAM: This locator should find
the tracking device, no problem.

98
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Ah-ha! Here it is!
Now let's deactivate it.

99
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Like I said, let's deactivate it...

100
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Let me try.

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,400
There you go. And you thought I wear
these just because they look good.

102
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,920
- Found anything yet, Alex?
- Not yet.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Whoa. Headache!

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,520
Hey, what is that? I think I see
a black speck. Or, is it a black dot?

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,120
Nah, it's kind of like
a black piece of rice...

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,120
- Why don't you zoom in and find out?
- Oh, yeah.

107
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,640
ALEX: Hey, that's a black blimp!

108
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
With two people on board.

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,560
SAM: All right, spies. Time to fly!

110
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,560
- How are we going to get in?
- This thing's got turbo, right?

111
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,720
You could have warned me
you were doing that.

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
- Check that out!
- SAM: I have a sneaky suspicion

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,120
this is the shrinking machine
all the action is from.

114
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,000
And there are the people responsible.

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,480
And they're, like, two feet tall!

116
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,320
MAN:<i>I don't care if you can't</i>
<i>locate the tracking device.</i>

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,240
<i>Use manual controls.</i>
<i>But get me my Great Wall!</i>

118
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,720
<i>Then return immediately to the island</i>
<i>so we can find out what's broken,</i>

119
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,120
<i>and get ready to carry out</i>
<i>the rest of my plan.</i>

120
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,320
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,920
We've got to deactivate that machine.

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
SAM: This should do the trick!

123
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,040
- (alarm)
- What was that?!

124
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,920
I'll check it out.

125
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,640
Time for plan B!

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
Sally! We have invaders!

127
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
ALEX: Invader this!

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,840
- (they shriek)
- Remind me not to arm wrestle them.

129
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Sinclair, get the one by the machine!
I'll take the other two!

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,200
- Ha! I've got you now!
- I wouldn't be so sure!

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
(yells)

132
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,440
Zap her with the Alpha X9 Ray Gun!

133
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,120
Oh, here comes my lunch.

134
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,080
(screams)

135
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
Oh, no! (screams)

136
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
It's time we stepped outside.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,240
SAM: Got you! Now stay put.

138
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,600
Where am I going to go?

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,880
Quick! Zap the other two!

140
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,800
This is just great. How am I
going to try my clothes on for my date?

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,840
JERRY:<i>An analysis of</i>
<i>the purple substance on Clover's pants</i>

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,240
<i>reveals this could only be the work of</i>
<i>one man, Diminutive Smalls.</i>

143
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,920
- Diminutive who?
<i>- Smalls.</i>

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
<i>Years ago, he was a WOOHP scientist</i>

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,120
<i>working on a formula</i>
<i>to increase strength by reducing mass.</i>

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
<i>There was a freak accident.</i>
<i>He and his two siblings</i>

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
<i>got shrunk by his own machine</i>
<i>but gained incredible strength.</i>

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
<i>It seems Diminutive has perfected the</i>
<i>shrinking process and wants revenge.</i>

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
If only he'd gotten therapy, then the
whole world wouldn't be in this mess.

150
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
<i>We've been picking up</i>

<i>he may have set up camp there.</i>

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,840
That's probably the island
they were talking about.

154
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,680
- We'll check it out right away!
<i>- He's dangerous, so be careful, spies.</i>

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,400
Hey, what about me?

156
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
<i>Yes. We're already working on</i>
<i>an antidote for you, Clover.</i>

157
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
Good. In two days, I've got this
date with this guy named Jason...

158
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
<i>I know. I know.</i>

159
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,800
Did I tell you about the dimple
he's got...

160
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh! So sorry! I think we're breaking up.

161
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,520
<i>Goodbye!</i>

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
(they laugh)

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,560
- ALEX: One... two... three...
- ALL: Hit it!

164
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,680
ALEX: These CADBOPs rock!

165
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
SAM: And roll!

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,520
ALL: Whoa.

167
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,520
Check out that creepy castle!

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,800
That's exactly what we're going to do.

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
This CADBOP is way cool.

170
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Look, there's the...
welcoming committee. Uh-oh!

171
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,080
MAN: Ready and... fire!

172
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,280
Fire again!

173
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,880
We're in a real-life video game!

174
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,560
Oh, no! We're trapped!

175
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
ALEX: Not so fast!

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Ha! Let's see them try to get us now!

177
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,280
- (they shriek)
- You and your big mouth! (screams)

178
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Ow!

179
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,400
Clover, we're coming!

180
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,600
SAM: Follow that tank!

181
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,600
- Now what are we going to do?
- Maybe there's a way in from the roof.

182
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,400
(grunts) We can't get any traction!

183
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
(thud)

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,320
I guess these are climb
almost anything dirt bikes.

185
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,640
I have an idea.

186
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
This should do the trick.

187
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
That wasn't the belt I lent you, was it?

188
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,440
DIMINUTIVE SMALLS:
We're ready to go.

189
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Clover, I want to thank you
for being our guinea pig.

190
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,360
Now that I see how well my device
works on humans...

191
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,320
The world's greatest monuments
all in one place!

192
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,560
...I've decided to dream
a little bigger.

193
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,560
Instead of shrinking and stealing

194
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,440
the monuments of the world
so I could decorate my island,

195
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm going to shrink and steal
the cities of the world,

196
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,360
people and all,
so I can have subjects to rule over!

197
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Listen, you're never
going to get away with this!

198
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,520
SMALLS:
Oh, like you're going to stop me!

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,120
All right, let's turn her into an ant!

200
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
(they laugh)

201
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Here's our chance.
I'll tackle the annoying one,

202
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,240
- you grab the other two.
- Gotcha.

203
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,120
I said I'll tackle the annoying one!

204
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,120
I know, so why are you going
after that one? She's the annoying one.

205
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,800
- Not half as annoying as that one.
- (laughs evilly)

206
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,120
SMALLS: Now, when this machine
gets nice and toasty,

207
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,400
you girls will be shrunk to
the size of dust particles.

208
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
Too bad we won't be able to watch,

209
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,320
but we've got a little city to shrink
and steal... called Tokyo.

210
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Maybe you've heard of it. (laughs)

211
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,120
- Now what?
- I can't reach my gadgets.

212
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,920
Look! My laser cutter eyelash curler
shrunk along with me.

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
This whole time I could have had
great lashes and didn't know it.

214
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,200
- That was close!
- Now we have a city to save!

215
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,520
Strap on your jet-pack backpacks
and let's blow this joint.

216
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Wait up!

217
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,720
There they are
and they're almost ready to go!

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,440
Maybe we can destroy
the blimp's steering system

219
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,480
so Smalls can't hold it in position.

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,120
How did those annoying little pests
get free?!

221
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,880
That's it!
Hand me the portable Alpha X9!

222
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Watch out! I think he sees us!

223
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,560
(panicked yells)

224
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,920
(laughs)

225
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
Yep, he sees us!

226
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,320
We need to split up
or we'll never get close enough.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,960
Cover for me. I'm going in!

228
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,320
(Smalls laughs)

229
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,880
Try this on for size!

230
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,480
- I can't watch.
- Me neither.

231
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,840
That gives me an idea.

232
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,680
OK, we're here. What now?

233
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,720
Follow my lead.

234
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,240
Oh, no!
My jet pack is running out of fuel.

235
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,640
So is mine!

236
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,760
- Really? Mine's fine.
- Alex!

237
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,360
Oops! I mean, oh, no!
I'm out of fuel, too!

238
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,360
We're trapped!

239
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,520
I told you we'd outlast them!
Now this is when the fun really starts.

240
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,160
- SMALLS: Ready?
- BOTH: Aim!

241
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,560
SMALLS: Fire!

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
(they panic)

243
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,720
You haven't seen the last of me!

244
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
Spies, once again, a job well done.

245
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
ALL: Thanks, Jerry.

246
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,200
Yo, guys, hello! Can you ease up a bit?

247
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,440
(doorbell)

248
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,320
Good thing I kept my old doll's outfits!

249
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,600
SAM: Hold on, I'll get it.

250
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,440
- This is for...
- CLOVER: Me.

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,480
- Yeah... (screams)
- OK, guys, quick!

252
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,800
Shoot me with the gun. I'll have
enough time before Jason shows up

253
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,040
to change from this doll outfit
into my special date outfit.

254
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,560
- Let me do it!
- No, let me!

255
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Oh, my!

256
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh, no! I can't wear these!
I can't wear anything!

257
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Jason can't see me like this.
What am I going to do?

258
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,120
Cancel! I'm going to have you
go to the door and cancel my date.

259
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,360
Tell him I'm sick. That I have the flu.
We'll have to reschedule.

260
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
Are you sure? I mean,
you could borrow something of ours.

261
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,720
No way, girls. I've been planning
my perfect outfit all week.

262
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
- (doorbell)
- Hi, Jason.

263
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,320
- Hi, girls. Is Clover ready?
- She's very sick. Spots everywhere.

264
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,920
She's sorry but she cannot
go out with you today.

265
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
(sighs) That was close.

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,760
Oops, sorry!

267
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
Oh. Hey, Mandy! What's going on?

268
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,200
(gasps) How totally lame!
He's actually falling for that?

269
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,120
Jason, wait! I'm feeling much better!
Those crazy ten minute flus!

270
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm glad Clover's back to
her normal self.

271
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm not sure "normal"
quite describes it.

272
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,320
Jason! Jaaaasooon!

273
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
(they laugh)
